_The Town That Dreaded Sundown_ starts with a prologue recounting the murders that occured in Texarkana in 1946. It talks about how the killer was never caught, and how the original film _The Town That Dreaded Sundown (1976)_ screens every year in Texarkana on Halloween. The film opens on one of those screenings. It's a drive-in. The camera pans down to a teen couple sitting on the hood of a car. He seems into the film, but she looks uneasy. She says it’s not her kind of movie. He asks her if she wants to go. She does, and the they head out. As they leave, the camera picks up a preacher imploring the patrons to remember that people really died back in 1946.

The couple head out for a quiet, deserted area where they can be alone. He makes small talk as they drive. The camera shows them at a tilted angle. It's an on-the-nose gimmick that foreshadows one of the film's biggest weaknesses. 

Soon they're parked. They start kissing, but the girl spots a man in the nearby woods. He's dressed just like the killer from the movie. But this is no prank. The man breaks the car's window with the butt of a revolver. He orders them out of the car, then forces the girl to turn around while he stabs the boy to death.

And we're off and running. By genre definitions, the film is a slasher, but I'm always hesitant to use that term. For many people, that equates to the _Friday the 13th_ and _Halloween_ series of films, which, for the most part, were more monster and survival-horror films. _The Town That Dreaded Sundown_ is more of a violent mystery. Victims are stalked and murdered in a brutal but stylish manner and we work along with the protagonist to deduce the killer's identity from a number of suspects. To that end, _The Town That Dreaded Sundown_ may be the first rural giallo.

There's a lot to like. The performances are solid, especially the supporting cast which includes Edward Herrmann as an opportunistic preacher, and Gary Cole as a	 sherrif’s deputy. 

The script’s meta-sequel approach works well. It avoids the trap of aggrandize the original film, regulating it to pulp entertainment. And by excising the original’s head-scratching bits of comic relief, this entry crafts a much taunter narrative.

But it’s far from perfect. Remember the gimmick shot I mentioned earlier? The movie is full of them. Every shot has to have a unique angle or trick. What’s worse is the one that really works isn’t keyed on. 

Consider the scene where a woman is fleeing the killer. It’s night. He chases her into a huge wheat field. He’s got a gun. He fires and she drops to the ground amid the wheat. He approaches, but can’t find the body. Cut to a bird’s eye shot of the field and we can see the woman crawling away from the killer as he stalks forward. They’re not more than six feet apart, but can’t see each other. The shot’s only held for a few moments before we cut back to a tight shot of the killer. 

Why? That was a great shot. Keep it. Cut the music. Just give us the sound of the wind and let us watch as she crawls, hoping against hope that he doesn’t see her. There meeting is inevitable, but the tension would have been palpable watching the two skew towards one another.

And then there’s the ending. Maybe they added it as a response to the original’s non-ending. But I think it was a mistake. They had a chance to retain the spirit of the original while making a statement about movie-violence (something the film thankfully doesn’t do too much spot-on) by simply ending the film with the herione leaving town. 

And the bad. Camera is too busy. Every shot doesn't need a gimmick. The ending feels obligitory. What if she just left? What if the message was that the killer would always be there as long as we were there. Would dovetail with the original's ambigious ending.
