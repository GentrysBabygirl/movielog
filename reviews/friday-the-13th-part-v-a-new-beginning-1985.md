_What were they thinking?_

That about sums up my reaction to _Friday the 13th Part V: A New Beginning_. After nailing the formula in _Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter (1984)_ , they throw everything out the window and nearly kill the franchise.

This entry follows Tommy, the young boy who survived the previous film by hacking Jason’s body to pieces with a machete. In a startling bit of plausibility, he’s spent the previous six years in a mental institution. He’s eighteen now, putting this film in the then-future of 1990[^1].

As a protagonist, Tommy leaves much to be desired. He says all of two-dozen words throughout the entire film. His emoting runs the gamut of confused to unsure. He's also prone to violent outbursts. Though these outbursts only serve as a red herring. The one time his vicious fighting skills could actually be of use, they fail him.

The film opens with Tommy arriving at a kind of halfway house for annoying teens[^2]. After one of the kids offs another with an axe, an unseen assailant begins murdering teens, staff, and pretty much everyone on screen. 

Harkening back to the original film, this entry is less a monster movie and more of a mystery thriller. But execution is sloppy. The script introduces characters only to kill them in the same scene. Several of the performances veer well into camp, such as the backwoods mother and son living next door to the halfway house. Worst of all, the eventual reveal is unsatisfying. It relies on some awkward exposition to explain the killer’s motive and even then makes little sense.

Fans hated it. The original plan was to setup a new killer for a new series of movies[^3]. But after this entry posted the lowest box office returns of the series thus far, the plan changed. Consider the title of the sequel: _Jason Lives: Friday the 13th Part VI (1986)_. 

But time has been kind to _Friday the 13th Part V: A New Beginning_. Knowing that the franchise rights itself, fans can appreciate this entry in a so-bad-it’s-good kind of way. The nonsense plot, Tommy’s non-dialog, and the over-the-top performances are all good for a laugh. One of the characters even dies in an outhouse after eating some spicy enchiladas. What were they thinking, indeed.

[^1]: I had to look this up. The series timeline gets really crazy from here on out as they keep skipping forward in time.

[^2]: It’s not made clear, but one presumes the state has transferred Tommy due to his having aged out of the system. But what happened to his sister?

[^3]: Apparently, the plan was for Tommy to assume the role of Jason. Again, what were they thinking?
