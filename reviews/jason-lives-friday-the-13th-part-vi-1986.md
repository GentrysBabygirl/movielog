Jason lives. Not _Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives_ but _Jason Lives: Friday the 13th Part VI_. After the head-scratching mess that was _Friday the 13th Part V: A New Beginning (1985)_, somebody in Paramount’s marketing division must have worried that kids would stop reading after the _Friday the 13th_ part of the title. I’m not sure things were that dire, but it does give you a sense of this entry’s mandate.

More-or-less ignoring the last film’s events, this entry opens with Tommy Jarvis determined to rid himself of the specter of Jason. To that end, he plans to dig up Jason’s corpse and incinerate it. He's even brought a buddy along for help[^1].

They dig up the corpse all right, but a bolt of lightening reanimates the maggot-filled carcass. Undead Jason makes short work of Tommy's buddy, but Tommy manages to escape and attempts to warn the local sherrif. The sherriff, of course, doesn't believe Tommy and runs him out of town.

Meanwhile, Jason resumes his murderous ways. He offs some corporate paintballers, and a few teen camp counselors before Tommy gets back to town. Thinking Tommy committed the murders himself, the sherrif locks Tommy up. 

Not to worry though, the sheriff’s plucky teen daughter Megan, frees Tommy from his cell. Together, they race to Camp Crystal Lake to stop Jason using a plan Tommy gleaned from reading a book on the occult.

This entry cements Jason’s transition from deranged madman to supernatural monster. This Jason has super human strength. Bullets can't kill him. Early on, Tommy looks to incinerate Jason, but the skies open up and the resulting rain prevents Tommy from striking a match. It’s a nice nod that casts Jason is something of a force of nature.

The script also sports a streak of self-referential black comedy. Consider the scene where Jason stalks a group of children. One of the boys looks at another and asks sarcastically: “So, what did you want to be when you grew up?”

The biggest problem is that, aside from Tommy, none of the characters have any kind of story. They exist only as fodder for Jason and thus, when Jason’s not on the screen, they’re boring. 

As for Tommy, he’s given things to do, sure, but it’s all flimsy drama. We can’t begin take any of it seriously. A stronger performer might have been able to rise above the material. But Thom Mathews’ performance as Tommy kept reminding me of Michael Dudikoff in _American Ninja (1985)_. Minus the ninja bad-assery. 

_Jason Lives: Friday the 13th Part VI_ isn’t an awful movie. The depiction of Jason is great, and the fourth-wall humor is a nice touch. But the forced melodrama and bland supporting cast drag things down. The only character we’re interested in is Jason and when he’s off-screen, this entry is a snooze.
