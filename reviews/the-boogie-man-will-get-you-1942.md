_The Boogie Man Will Get You_ is not a great film. Perhaps, it's not even a good one. But for fans of Boris Karloff and Peter Lorre, it is, at times, an entertaining one. Despite the title, this is not a horror film, but rather a dark comedy in the vein of _Arsenic and Old Lace (1944)_. To that end, Karloff and Lorre make a fine pair of lovable murderers.

The plot involves a young divorcee, Winnie, who buys Karloff's crumbling tavern home and turns it into an inn. Karloff agrees to sell, provided he be permitted to stay on and finish his experiments in his basement laboratory. 

Of course, Winnie doesn't know that Karloff's experiments involve trying to create an army of atomic supermen to win the war. Or that his test subjects consist of the various traveling salesmen that knock on his door. Or that all his experiments have been fatal failures, leaving him with a small morgue full of corpses. One would think this sort of thing would have come up during the walk-through, but the film gives Winnie the mental acuity of a toddler.

Lorre plays the town doctor, a smarmy opportunist who also holds the mortgage on Karloff's home. Besides being the town doctor, Lorre's character is also the town mortician, town notary, town councilman, and town treasurer.

There's a scene where Lorre, having been called in his capacity as town sheriff, confronts Karloff about one of the traveling salesman's corpses. With idillic pride, Karloff explains how his experiments could end the war. With dollar signs in his eyes, Lorre sees how the experiments could make him rich. Never mind the room full of corpses. Soon they're partners bemoaning the lack of quality test subjects. It’s a great bit of black comedy that hints at the film’s potential.

But that potential is never realized. Instead, the film shifts from black comedy to murder mystery, as guests of the inn turn up knifed in the back. Things culminate with the cast being held hostage in Karloff's laboratory by an escaped fascist looking to blow up a nearby munitions depot. Because, you know, what better spot to open an inn then next to a munitions depot. It's an inane end to a wildly uneven film.
