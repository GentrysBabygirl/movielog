_The Boogie Man Will Get You_ is not a great film. Perhaps, it's not even a good one. But for fans of Boris Karloff and Peter Lorre, it is, at times, an entertaining one. Despite the title, and Karloff's presence, the film is not a horror, but rather a dark comedy in the vein of _Arsenic and Old Lace (1944)_.

The plot involves a young divorcee, Winnie, who buys Karloff's crumbling tavern home and turns it into an inn. Karloff agrees to sell, provided he stay on to finish his experiments in his basement laboratory. 

Of course, Winnie doesn't know that Karloff's experiments involve trying to create an army of atomic supermen to win the war. Or that his test subjects consist of the various traveling salesmen that knock on his door. Or that all his experiments have been fatal failures, leaving him with a small morgue full of corpses. One would think that would have come up in the walk-through, but the film gives Winnie the mental acuity of a toddler.

The best scenes in the film are those between Karloff and Peter Lorre. Lorre plays the town doctor. He also holds the mortgage on Karloff's home. Besides being the town doctor, Lorre's character is also the town mortician, town notary, town councilman, and town treasurer. He's like a legalized con-man. Lorre plays him with perfectly. There's a great scene where Lorre, having been called in his capacity as sheriff, confronts Karloff about one of the traveling salesman's corpses. Once Karloff explains his experiments, Lorre is relieved. He thought the old professor had lost it. Never mind the room full of corpses. Soon they're partners bemoaning the lack of quality test subjects. 

From here the film shifts to a murder mystery, as guests of the inn turn up knifed in the back. Things get wrapped courtesy of an escaped fascist looking to blow up the nearby munitions depot. Because, you know, what better spot to open an inn then next to a munitions depot. It's an inane end to a wildly uneven film.
