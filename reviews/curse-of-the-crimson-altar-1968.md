The _Curse of the Crimson Altar_ (_The Crimson Cult_ here in the USA) can't quite decide how seriously it wants to take itself. We get that feeling right from the opening scene. A suit-clad man, Peter Manning stands looking dazed as a nude woman suffers a whip while lying strapped to a table. Around the table stand men in black robes, including one with a goat. A blue-skinned Barbra Steel introducing herself as Lavidia, the "Keeper of the Black Secret". She asks if he knows why he's here. He does. She asks if he's ready to sign. He is. A man brings over a book and Peter signs his name. Then Lavidia hands Peter a dagger. Peter stabs the girl on the table without so moment's hesitation. There's a quick-cut to the goat, which seems distressed. Lavidia snaps her fingers. There's a crack of thunder and a muscular man dressed in a leather bikini bottom, leather arm-bands, and a studded leather cap with antlers brings over a branding iron which he presses into Peter's chest. 

Yes, that happens. The film packs a few more of these trippy S&M tinged sequences, but they exist more-or-less outside the main narrative.

The story concerns Peter's brother, Robert, played by Mark Eden. When Peter doesn't return home, Robert goes looking for him at his last known location, a remote country estate called Craxton Lodge. Robert's arrival coincides with a local festival celebrating the burning of the witch Lavidia some three hundred years earlier. The estate’s owner, Morely, played by Christopher Lee, claims to have never heard of Peter, but invites Robert to stay the night. Robert agrees, planning to go down to the local village the following day and make inquiries. 

Robert also meets another of the locals, Professor Marsh, played by Boris Karloff. Marsh, conveniently, is an expert on witchcraft. 

As the film unwinds, Robert discovers the truth behind his brother's disappearance, as well as the truth behind Lavidia. In keeping with the film's uncertainty in regards to its own seriousness, there's a Scooby-Doo aspect to the mystery, but by the time the credits roll we're left wondering if the scenes with Lavidia were meant to be real or imagined. Sometimes ambiguity helps a film resonate, as we turn over the plot in our heads. This is not such a case. This just feels like the filmmakers were too cool for school and found the horror elements a bit contemptuous. A real shame since the cast is loaded with talent.

After my first viewing of _The Curse of the Crimson Altar_ , I considered the film something of a guilty pleasure. The over-the-top dream sequences and gratuitous nudity were good for a chuckle. 

But watching it a second time, I found the film far less entertaining. Sure, watching Karloff prove he still had it even at eighty warms a movie-lover’s heart, but that’s about all the movie has going for it. Lee is fine in a role that doesn’t give him much to do, but Barbara Steele is wasted. The stories mystery elements, already weak on the first viewing, border on tedious the second time around.

Given that it was one of Karloff’s final films, it’s probably required viewing for any serious fan of classic horror. Just don't watch it a second time.
