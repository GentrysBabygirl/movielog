They don’t make movies like this anymore. Nowadays, B-Movies are nothing but manufactured, formulaic, schlock neutered for release on basic cable. The manic energy present in the best of 70s grindhouse pictures is gone, along with any sense of pride from the people involved. Instead, we get half-assed camp with D-list performers that can’t disguise their contempt for the material.

To that end, _WolfCop_ is a rarity. A lurid pulp creation made by talented folks who seemed to love making the movie. You can feel it in every over-the-top minute. 

Consider the transformation scene. A genre staple. Our protagonist, Lou, stumbles drunk into a dive bar bathroom. As he relieves himself, the change is violent and sudden. Lou lets out a howl. His urine stream turns blood red as his penis sprouts hair and inflates like a trick balloon. 

It’s a crazy shot, but not gratuitous. In leading with the genitals, WolfCop conveys the character’s transformation pain better than any werewolf film I can recall. I laughed and cringed in the same breath.

Not every scene is as calculated. Some scenes, like WolfCop tricking out his police cruiser, or foiling a gang of graffiti artists by hosing them down with his urine, are just silly. But that’s okay. The film’s only pushing the werewolf genre tropes to their natural extremes. 

In _WolfCop_, it’s not “What if a cop became a werewolf?” It’s “What if a cop from an exploitation picture became a werewolf super cop?” The resulting mishmash of cop drama and supernatural horror is a tone-perfect, greasy hamburger of a movie that clocks in at a scant seventy nine minutes. 

But let’s face it, the bit about the ballooning penis already told you everything you needed to know, didn’t it?
