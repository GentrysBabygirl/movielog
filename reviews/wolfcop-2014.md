:pull_quote: _WolfCop_ is about an alcholic sherrif's deputy who becomes a werewolf and uses his newfound powers to clean up his small town. If you think this sounds rediculous, this is not the movie for you. If you think this sounds awesome, this is not the movie for you. If you this this sounds rediculous _and_ awesome, you're in for a treat.

They don't make movies like this anymore. Nowdays, B-Movies are manufactured, formulaic shlock nuetuered for release on basic cable. The manic energy and genunine love for the genre present in the best of 70s grindhouse pictures is gone. Instead, we get half-assed camp with D-list performers that can't hide their distain for the material.

To that end, _WolfCop_ is a rarity. A lurid pulp creation made by folks who seemed to love making the movie. You can feel it in every over-the-top minute.
