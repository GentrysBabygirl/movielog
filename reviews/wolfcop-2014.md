They don't make movies like this anymore. Nowdays, B-Movies are manufactured, formulaic shlock nuetuered for release on basic cable. The manic energy and genunine love for the genre present in the best of 70s grindhouse pictures is gone. Instead, we get half-assed camp with D-list performers that can't hide their distain for the material.

To that end, _WolfCop_ is a rarity. A lurid pulp creation made by talented folks who seemed to love making the movie. You can feel it in every over-the-top minute. 

When our protagonist, Lou, undergoes his first transformation, he's drunk in a dive bar. He stumbles into the bathroom and begins reliving himself at the urinal. The change is violent and sudden. Lou lets out a howl. We see his urine stream turn blood red as his penis sprouts hair and inflates like a trick balloon. 

It's a crazy shot, but it's not gratuitous. By going with the genitals, WolfCop does a better job conveying character's pain during the transformation than any werewolf film I can recall. I laughed and cringed in the same breath.

Not every scene is as calculated. Some scenes, such as when WolfCop tricks out his police cruiser, are just silly. But the film knows they're silly and treats them accordingly. 

_WolfCop_ is not a serious horror film. The result is a tone-perfect, greasy hamburger of a movie that clocks in at a scant seventy nine minutes.
