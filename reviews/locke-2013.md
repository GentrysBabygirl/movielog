_Locke_ is not a great film, but it is a good one. If you're on the fence about seeing it, do so. Don't read any further, as we're going to talk about plot and this movie works best the less you know going in.

Still here? Okay, here we go.

_Locke_ opens with the a wide shot of a construction site. It's dark. Spotlights illuminate a massive foundation hole. Early the next morning, they will pour the concrete. It will be the largest commercial pour in Europe. Ivan Locke (Tom Hardy) is the construction manager in charge.

The film opens with Ivan getting into his car. He pulls away from the curb and makes a call. He gets a woman's voicemail. He tells her he's gotten her message and that he's on his way.

As the film unfolds we learn that Ivan travelling to London from Birmingham. We also learn that circumstances surrounding the trip. Last year he had a one night stand while away on a job. The first and only time he's strayed in fifteen years of marriage. But the woman, Bethan, became pregnant. Now, the baby has come early and she's gone into labor.

The rest of the film happens in near real-time, as Ivan juggles a series of calls. We learn more about him. He is both dilligent and pragmatic. The qualities that made him a world-class manager. The kind of man who makes checklists but is able to adapt to unforseen circumstances. 

And so it is with a delibrate logic that he approaches his current situation. He has fathered a child. Now he must do right by it. A deep-rooted pyschological need drives him. Ivan's father abandoned him. Ivan refuses to do the same.

This information is doled out in bits as the film unfolds. Each nugget raising the emotional stakes and increasing the story’s tension. In time, Ivan loses his job, his family and his home. He accepts these events with a calm detachment. These are the consequences of his actions. He compartmentalizes them. He holds to his logic. He must be there for his child. Early on, when Bethan asks if he loves her, Ivan asks "How can I? I don't know you." His tone is not cruel. It is the voice of a man trying to convince her of the truth he needs to believe.

Watching Ivan’s world unravel is a riviting emotional journey.  It’s a testament to quality of the script that setting the entire film in Ivan’s car doesn’t feel like a stunt. Instead, it feels natural. Tom Hardy holds your attention from the very first scene. Confining him to the car only adds to the claustrophobic sense of desperation that he film cultivates so well. By the end, we’re hanging on every word.

But then, just as abruptly as it began, it's over. Ivan's world has changed and he heads off to what will be, for him, a new life. I didn't like this ending, but I'm not sure how I would change it. It felt anti-climatic. Not enough to ruin the film, but enough that it undercut the emotional arc. But perhaps that's the point. Just like Ivan, things are over and we're left looking at them with an odd sense of detachment.
