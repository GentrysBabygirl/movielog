It's not a good sign when the making-of featurette on the DVD is more interesting than the feature film. 

_The Bloody Judge_ is set in England during the final days of the [Bloody Assizes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloody_Assizes). George Jeffreys, the titular Bloody Judge (played by Christopher Lee), was real historical figure who meted out death sentences to suppress the burgeoning rebellion, only to end up on the wrong side of the [The Glorious Revolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glorious_Revolution). 

If the film had focused on this, it might have turned out much better.

But instead, most of the screen time belongs to a group of fictitious characters. After putting her sister to death for witchcraft, Jeffreys becomes obsessed with a peasant girl named Mary. Mary's lover, Harry, has connections to the rebels, infuriating Jeffreys. But Harry is the son of Lord Wessex, a sometime friend of Jeffreys, which makes things tricky. Jeffreys orders Mary arrested; Harry frees her. Jeffreys captures them both; they escape. Then the revolution happens.

Oh, and there's a blind oracle who may or may not be psychic.

The logic behind all these side-plots become clear in the DVD supplement. The film had a slew of financing sources and each financier wanted a different kind of film. One wanted a horror movie. One wanted a historical drama. One wanted an exploitation picture. At least no one wanted comedy.

Making things even worse, Lee and Franco disagreed on how Jeffreys should be played. Lee wanted to be faithful to history.  Franco wanted something more "dynamic". I don't know what that means and I don't think Lee did either.
 
The resulting mis-mash is surprisingly boring. Think long, ponderous scenes full of exposition interspersed with the occasional sequence of Howard Vernon dressed up like Boris Karloff in _The Tower of London (1939)_ torturing a semi-nude woman covered in Technicolor blood. 

If you're in it for these exploitation sequences, I recommend liberal use of the fast-forward button.

The disparate financing also explains the myriad of alternate titles. In the US it was known as _Night of the Blood Monster_. In England it was _Witch Killer of Broadmoor_. Note that there is no Broadmoor in the film. Granted there's no Blood Monster either, but why Broadmoor? That's one question the making-of featurette couldn't answer.
