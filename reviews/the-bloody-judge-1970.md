:pull_quote: It's not a good sign when the making-of featurette on the DVD is more interesting than the feature film, but such is the case with _The Bloody Judge_.

_The Bloody Judge_ is set in England during the final days of King James II. Christopher Lee plays George Jeffreys, a judge who meted out death sentences to suppress the burgeoning rebellion. These sham trials became known as the Bloody Assizes. 

In a making-of featurette, Lee describes Jeffreys as a Jekyll-and-Hyde figure. A brilliant legal mind who rose to the highest justice in the land and a merciless executioner who sentenced hundreds to their deaths. Had the film focused on this dichotomy, it might have worked.

Instead, most of the screen time belongs to a pair of fictitious characters. Mary, a peasant girl Jeffreys obsesses over, and Harry, Mary's lover. Harry's in league with the rebels, but his father is one of Jeffreys' political allies. The film revolves around this triangle. Jeffreys orders Mary arrested. Harry frees her. Jeffreys captures them both. They escape. Then the revolution happens.

There's also a blind oracle who may or may not be psychic.

These disparate plot points came from the film's funding. The film had a slew of financing sources and each financier wanted a different film. One wanted a horror movie. One wanted a historical drama. Another wanted an exploitation picture. At least no one wanted a comedy.

Compounding matters, Lee and director Jes√∫s Franco disagreed on how to portray Jeffreys. Lee wanted to be faithful to history.  Franco wanted something more "dynamic." I don't know what he meant by "dynamic" and I don't think Lee did either.

The resulting mishmash is dull and disjointed. Long, wooden, scenes leaden with exposition, interrupted by an occasional bit of exploitation. In this case a man dressed like Boris Karloff in _The Tower of London (1939)_, torturing a semi-nude woman covered in Technicolor blood.  If you're in it for these bits, I recommend liberal use of the fast-forward button.

The financing amalgam also explains the myriad of alternate titles. In the US it was _Night of the Blood Monster_. In England it was _Witch Killer of Broadmoor_, even though there's no Broadmoor in the film. Granted, there's no Blood Monster either, but why Broadmoor? That's one question the making-of featurette couldn't answer.
