_The Bloody Judge_ is set in England during the final days of the [Bloody Assizes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloody_Assizes). Lord Chancellor Jeffreys, the titular Bloody Judge (played by Christopher Lee), was real historical figure who meted out death sentences to suppress the burgeoning rebellion, only to end up on the wrong side of the [The Glorious Revolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glorious_Revolution). 

Sounds promising, right? Like _Witchfinder General (1968)_ but with Christopher Lee instead of Vincent Price? 

Yeah, not so much.

Most of the screen time belongs to a group of fictitious characters. Mary is a peasant girl that Jeffreys becomes obsessed with after sentencing her sister to death for witchcraft. Mary's lover, Harry, is the son of Lord Wessex, a political rival of Jeffreys. Harry has connections to the rebels. 

Oh, and there's also a blind oracle who may or may not be psychic.

If this seems a bit convoluted, then I've done a good job explaining the movie. According to a supplementary interview with director Jes√∫s Franco, the film had a slew of financing sources. Each financier wanted a different kind of film. One wanted a horror movie with a historical backdrop. One wanted a historical drama. One wanted an exploitation picture. 

At least no one wanted a comedy.

The result is disjointed and boring. Think long, ponderous scenes full of exposition interspersed with the occasional sequence of Howard Vernon dressed up like Boris Karloff in _The Tower of London (1939)_ torturing a nude or semi-nude women covered in Technicolor blood. 

Making things even worse, Lee and Franco disagreed on how Jeffreys should be played. Lee wanted to be faithful to history, while Franco wanted something, well, else. As a result Lee seems to be acting in a different movie. His performance engaging but it doesn't fit the film around it.

On the plus side, the Portuguese locations do a good job doubling for 17th century England. But it's a bad sign when the making-of extra on the DVD is more interesting than the movie itself.
