_The Bloody Judge_ is set in England at the end of the [Bloody Assizes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloody_Assizes). Christopher Lee plays Lord Chancellor Jeffreys, the titluar Bloody Judge. 

The story revolves around Jeffreys metting out death sentences to supress the burdgening rebellion, only to end up on the wrong side of the [The Glorious Revolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glorious_Revolution). There's a sub-plot involving a peasant girl, Mary, that Jeffreys is convinced is either a witch or in league with the rebels. Mary is involved with Harry, the son of Lord Wessex. Harry is involved with the insurgents.

If this seems a bit convoluted, then I've done a good job explaining the movie. According to the supplementary interviews with Lee and director Jes√∫s Franco (credited as J. Frank Manera), the film had a slew of financing sources, each of which wanted a different kind of film. One wanted a horror with a historical backdrop, one wanted a historical drama, one wanted a n exploitation picture. Making things even worse, Lee and Franco disagreed on how Jeffreys should be played. Lee wanted to be faithful to history, while Franco wanted something, well, else. As a result Lee seems to be acting in a different movie. His performance engaging but it doesn't match the film around it.

Basically, the film is scenes of exposition broken up by scenes of nude or semi nude women covered in technicolor blood being tortured. 

The Portugal locations do a good job doubling for 17th century England.

- mention the karloff homage.
