Bogart plays Frank Taylor, a senior machinist and family man in line for a rich promotion to foreman. When he’s passed over in favor of a younger coworker named Dombrowski, Frank falls in with the titular Legion, a black-robed hate group who runs Dombrowski out of town. Frank ascends to foreman, and for a short while things are great, but after Frank’s Legion-mandated recruiting activities lead to an accident at the shop, Frank is demoted in favor of his neighbor. Once again, the Legion come to Frank’s aid, but the secrecy and violence begin to wear on Frank who takes to drinking heavily, leading to the departure of his wife, along with their young son. Alone and despondent, a drunken Frank confesses everything to his longtime friend Ed, but panics the next morning and tells local Legion head Cliff what he’s done. Cliff cooks up a rumor about Ed in order to rile up the Legion, who kidnap Ed, but things don’t go as planned, leaving Frank with blood on his hands and nowhere to turn.

Bogart shines in what should have been a break-out role, and the script’s multi-faceted depiction of the Legion is enlightening, from the radio demagogues cultivating resentment and fear all the way to the profiteers behind the scenes, cashing in on the sales of Legion uniforms and revolvers. But Frank’s going from honest family-man to drunken womanizer in what seems like a matter of weeks gives the film a trite, after-school-special feel that undermines the still-relevant social context.
