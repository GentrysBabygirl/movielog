Like any good script, _The Big Steal_ starts as late into the story as possible. Aboard an ocean liner that's just docked in Veracruz, Mexico, William Bendix bursts into Robert Michum's cabin holding a gun. He's after something he believes Mitchum stole. Mitchum says he doesn't have it, that Bendix has got the wrong man. Bendix doesn't believe it and moves to arrest Mitchum. Mitchum overpowers Bendix, knocking him out. Mitchum takes the Bendix's gun and identification. The identification reads Captain Vincent Blake of the US Army. 

After deboarding, Mitchum crosses paths with Jane Greer. It's a short meeting, as Mitchum has to duck out of sight as Bendix emerges from the ship. Once the coast is clear, Mitchum tries to catch a cab, only to find Greer has gotten the last one. 

Cut to a room inside the Hotel Mexico. We see Patric Knowles packing to depart. There's a knock at the door. Knowles pulls a gun and moves to the side of the door, ready to plug whoever comes in. Then we hear Greer's voice, telling him to open up. We learn that Knowles is Greer's fiancee. But she's not here to marry him, she's here becausae he ran off with her savings, about two thousand dollars. She wants it back. 

Knowlews tries to sweet talk her but Greer cuts him off saying, "The last time you did that it cost me my bank account." Knowles tries to make her feel bad for harping on him about the money saying, "There's that dollar sign again." But Greer snaps back, "Where? I don't see it. Come on, hand it over." Then, dripping with sarcasm, "I was saving that money for my truseau." 

Knowles gives Greer the slip, and a few beats later we learn that Mitchum is after Knowles too. 

Thus the film is set. Bendix is chasing Mitchum who, along with Greer, is chasing Knowles. Mitchum and Greer form an uneasy partnership as they travel across the Mexcian coutnryside from Veracruz to Tehuac√°n.  As the story unfolds we learn what was stolen, and who did the stealing. Michum and Greer warm to each other. Everything culiminates in a suprising, but satisfying finale.

It's refreshing to see such an independent female character. She's self assured without being arrogant. Insistent without being whiny. The script may leave the fisticuffs to the male characters, but Greer's character holds her own in the numerous bouts of verbal sparring.


It's a great setup. All the characters have to keep moving so the movie never lulls. But what makes _The Big Steal_ stand out is the script. It's full of great dialog. 


The script also does a great job of subverting our expectations. From the anything but inept Mexican police inspector, to the surprising but plausible finale, the script does a great job of keeping us on our toes. 

There's also a nice touch where Mitchum actually wears some of the results of his tussles. From a bloody nose to a beaten face, these fights have visible consequences, something all to rare in Hollywood.

It's not a perfect film. The car chase feels tacked on and forced. And Knowles and Bendix don't quite hold their own against Mitchum and Greer in terms of star wattage. But really, these are weaknesses instead of faults.

What do we know so far? Somebody stole something and Bendix, a US Army captain, thinks Mitchum did the stealing. Well, we don't know for sure that Bendix is an Army captaion, do we? He has identification, but that doesn't prove anything.  And yet the movie is off and running. That's good storytelling.
