In _Support Your Local Sheriff!_, James Garner plays an easy-going drifter who chances into the job of sheriff in a frontier boomtown. With a combination of witty repartee and improbable skills with a six-shooter, he takes down the Danby gang and tames the town.  Walter Brennan plays the Danby patriarch. Bruce Dern is his dim-witted son. Jack Elam is the town yokel who winds up as Garner's deputy. Henry Morgan plays the town's mayor.

One of the film's running gags revolves around the local brothel's name: Madame Orr's. That should give you an idea of the script's level of wit. And yet, Garner is impossible to dislike. He seems to amble through the film self-aware; as bemused by the script's forced humor as we are. He plays well opposite Elam and Morgan, elevating their performances. Through sheer charisma, James Garner makes this movie work.

But he can't help Joan Hackett. Was the script trying to parody the [Hawksian woman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawksian_woman)? A self-aware version of the Hawks archetype could have been a lot of fun, but Hackett's character is little-more than a clown.
