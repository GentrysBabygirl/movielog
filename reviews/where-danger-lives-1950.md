Ordinarly, I like to warn readers that I'm going to spoil plot points. In the case of _Where Danger Lives_, I don't think it matters. This is one of those films where it takes the hero the entire film to deduce what the audience figures out in the first ten minutes.

The film opens with doctor Jeff Cameron treating a patient. Robert Mitchum plays Jeff. The patient is a little girl. Jeff is telling her a story about elephants. This is the script's way of telling us that Jeff is a wholesome kind of guy. Mitchum is miscast in a part that would better suit Henry Fonda, but that’s the least of the film’s problems. 

After finishing with the little girl, Jeff clocks out, eager for a big date with his best girl Julie. Julie is another wholesome character, a nurse at the hospital. But Jeff has to cancel his plans when he's called to assist with a patient that just came in, a suicide attempt.

The patient is Margo, a not-so-wholesome girl played by Faith Domergue. Like Mitchum, she’s miscast. Unlike Mitchum, it’s hard to overlook just how wrong she is for the role. To be fair, it’s a hard part to play. 

Back to the story. Jeff treats Margo and then begins seeing her socially. He falls hard. Here’s where the film makes its critical mistake. Margo has to do more than seduce Jeff, she has to seduce the entire audience. We have to buy a successful doctor like Jeff overlooking a myriad of red flags and throwing his life and career away for a woman he just met. 

But we don’t buy it. The entire romance is unconvincing. 

Soon Margo breaks it Jeff that she has to leave for Nassau. It seems her father has come home and, upon finding out about Jeff, decided it best that Margo take a trip. 

Jeff doesn’t take it well. He a few too many and goes to Margo’s house. There he confronts her father Mr. Lannington, played by third-billed Claude Rains in his only scene. Here Jeff discovers the first of many things we already suspected. Lannington isn't her father at all, but her husband![^1] 

Jeff and Lannington get into a little scuffle. Jeff knocks down Lannington who pummels Jeff with a fireplace poker. Jeff clocks Lannington, knocking him out cold. Jeff, still reeling from the fireplace poker blows to his head, stumbles into the bathroom to get some water. When he returns, Margo tells Jeff that Lannington is dead. 

Now, at this point it's obvious to anyone watching that Margo killed her husband while Jeff was out of the room. But, since the rest of the film is predicated on Jeff believing he did it, a series of contrived plot mechanations are necessary. As the film rolls on the pair will ”just miss" the news. The car radio won’t work. Someone will draws a beard on a Margo’s police picture, preventing her from being recognized. 

Anyway, Margo convinces Jeff to make a run for the Mexico border. Jeff agrees. The film explains this by having Jeff tell us he has a concussion. This is the worst concussion you've ever seen. Jeff blacks out, loses the ability to think straight and, by the time the film's predictable conclusion rolls around, is paralized on the left side of his body.

From here the film shifts to a road movie, as Margo and Jeff prowl through the small, back woods towns of the southwest. In one town they’re nearly thrown in jail after a fender-bender with a drunken immigrant. In another they’re brought before the town sherrif for being clean shaven during “Whiskers Week.” 

In time, the film tells us that Margo is crazy. It’s played as a big reveal, but we’ve known it the entire time. 

Everything wraps up near the Mexico border. Jeff and Margo are holed up in a dingy hotel room waiting to cross. Margo reveals she’d been stashing Lannington’s money in a Mexican bank. Jeff finally realizes that Margo killed Lannington, only to collapse from his concussion. Margo smothers him with a pillow. Believing Jeff dead, Margo heads for the border. She’s almost across when she sees Jeff shambling down the street. His left side is paralyzed. She begs him to stop, to not come any further. 

Domergue doesn’t look like a desparate woman, she looks like an actress unsure of what to do. “Don’t make me shoot,” she says to no one as she pulls a small revolver from her purse. 

Jeff keeps coming. Margo shoots and misses. The border guards shoot Margo, who dies but not before confessing to the authorities that she killed Lannington alone. Jeff wakes up in a hospital. He’s going to be okay. Julie is there waiting for him.
 
It’s a trite finale that borders on insulting. Granted, I can’t think of an ending that could have redeemed the previous eighty-or-so minutes, but having Jeff suffer some kind of lasting consequences for his actions would have been a start. 

If you ignore the trite plot and Deomergue’s unsteady performance, _Where Danger Lives_ functions as a nightmarish hallucinatory journey. Mitchum gets conked on the head and descends into a kind of backwoods hell. _This_ might have been a good movie, but we’ll never know. Too much gets in the way.
