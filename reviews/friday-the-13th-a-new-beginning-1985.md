_What were they thinking?_

That about sums up my reaction to _Friday the 13th: A New Beginning_. After nailing the formula in _Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter (1984)_, they throw everything out the window and nearly kill the franchise.

This entry follows Tommy, the young boy who survived the previous film by hacking Jason’s body to pieces with a machete. In a startling bit of plausibility, he’s spent the previous six years in a mental institution. He’s eighteen now, putting this film in the then-future of 1990[^1].

Tommy is a frustrating protagonist. He's superficial to the plot and says less than two-dozen words throughout the film. He spends most of his time either looking confused or violently acting out. This petulant behavior may have fit a younger actor, but here it’s laughably awkward[^2].

The film opens with Tommy arriving at a kind of halfway house for annoying teens[^3]. After one of the kids offs another with an axe, an unseen assailant begins murdering teens, staff, and pretty much everyone on screen.

Harkening back to the original  _Friday the 13th (1980)_, this entry is less a monster movie and more of a mystery thriller. But the execution is sloppy. Characters are introduced and killed in the same scene. Several of the performances, such as the backwoods mother and son living adjacent to the halfway house, veer well into camp. Worst of all, the eventual reveal is unsatisfying. It relies on some awkward exposition to explain the killer’s motive and even then makes little sense.

But time has been kind to _Friday the 13th: A New Beginning_. Knowing that the franchise rights itself, fans can appreciate this entry in a so-bad-it’s-good kind of way. The nonsense plot, Tommy’s non-dialog, and the over-the-top performances are all good for a laugh. One of the characters even dies in an outhouse after eating some spicy enchiladas. What were they thinking, indeed.

[^1]: I had to look this up. The series timeline gets really crazy from here on out as they keep skipping forward in time.

[^2]: According to the IMDb, Cory Feldman was going to reprise his role as Tommy. But when he was unavailable due to The Goonies (1985), the filmmakers rewrote the part for an older actor. One suspects it was a very quick rewrite.

[^3]: It’s not made clear, but one presumes the state has transferred Tommy due to his having aged out of the system. But what happened to his sister?
