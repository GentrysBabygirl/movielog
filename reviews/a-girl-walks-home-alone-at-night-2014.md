_A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night_ is being billed as the first Iranian vampire film. This is misleading. A better description would be "the first Farsi language vampire film". There's nothing inherently Iranian about this film. Like all good movies, it transcends borders.

The story harkens back to the Tarantino-inspired noirs of the 90's. A young man deals with his junkie father. When the father can't pay for his drugs, the dealer takes the young man's prized classic convertible as payment. Later, the young man goes to the drug dealer's house in an attempt to barter the car back. When he arrives, he finds the drug dealer dead. The young man flees the scene, but not before taking a case full of drugs and cash. 

Soon the young man is dealing. He grows frustrated with his father, and banishes him from the house. The next morning, the young man finds his father brutally murdered. Beliving it was retribution for the drugs and money he stole, the young man readies to leave town. Before he goes, he visits the girl he's recently met and asks her to come with.



The story follows A, a young man living in Bad City. As the film opens we see him steal a cat. He takes the cat and returns home in his shiney classic convertible. We can sense his attachment to the car, and learn he worked very hard to afford it.

When A returns home we see the nature of his home life. His mother is dead and his father is a heroine junkie. It's unclear if the mother's death is what sent him to drugs. When A's father can't pay his dealer for the drugs he needs, the dealer takes A's convertible. 

A works as a groundskeeper for a rich family. He steals a pair of diamond earings in the hopes of using them to buy back his car. Later that night he arrives at the dealer's apartment, passing a girl on the way inside. When there's no answer to his knock, A finds the door open and goes inside. A gruesome sight awaits. He finds the dealer dead. Thinking quickly, he takes a case full of drugs and cash and flees the scene.

Soon A is dealing himself. 

There's a parrallel story that follows the girl. She's a vampire, preying on the city's destitute and depraved. There is a loneliness in her. 

Her and A meet. There's a connection. 

To appreciate why _?_ is such a good film, we must discuss the final scene. It's the sort of scene that would never come out of a Hollywood production. ? and the girl are driving out of town. ? doesn't know that she's a vampire, but he knows that she killed his father. They drive in silence. After a bit, ? pulls the car over. He gets out and paces in the headlights. We can see the emotions wash over him. She watches in silence. For the first time, we see her in a vulnerable light. In a Hollywood production this scene would include a monologue followed by an emotional exchange. In the silence ? gives us something truer and more powerful.
