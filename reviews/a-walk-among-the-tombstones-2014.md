_A Walk Among the Tombstones_ is a film without an identity. Despite being based on a novel and adapted by director Scott Frank, it feels like it was made by committee.  Lets run through the familiar plot points. 

Recovering alcoholic ex-cop who quits both drinking and the force after a heroic effort? Check. Heroic effort turns out to be not so heroic after all? Check. Street-smart, plucky sidekick (must be female or a minority) for the cop? Check. 

What do we have so far? All the makings for a derivative heart-warmer. Gruff ex-cop meets plucky street-kid, street kid melts ex-cop’s tough exterior. Yeah, that’s all here.

Except there’s another movie in here too. One where the ex-cop now works as an unlicensed private investigator. Where he takes the case of a drug trafficer who’s wife was kidnapped, tortured and killed. Where he uncovers the killers as a pair of horrific sociopaths who’ve been doing this for a long time.

This other movie has the potential to be good. But it never comes together. Too much gets in the way. 

There are lots of redundant scenes. The movie opens with one. The ex-cop (before he was ex) sits in the car with his partner. The partner bemoans the cop’s drinking, saying he worries he can’t count on him. The cop gets out of the car and walks into a bar. It’s morning. He grabs a paper and sits down. Without a word the bartender brings him a coffee and two shots of whiskey. 

Why not just open with him walking into the bar? The morning light, the lack of dialog, the coffee and two shots; they tell us everything we need to know. Not to mention we never see that partner again. 

As the movie wore on, I found myself getting more and more angry. There’s no respect for the audience’s intelligence. Perhaps the most telling example comes when the ex-cop discovers some badly written romance fiction. He reads it aloud, even though the camera is looking at the page. This is a film that doesn’t even trust the audience to be able to read.

I wanted to like this movie, but I can’t recommend it. Perhaps the most damning thing about _A Walk Among the Tombstones_ is that Liam Neeson’s would-be New Jersey accent is the least of its problems.
