_A Walk Among the Tombstones_ has the potential to be good, but it never comes together. Too much gets in the way.

The plot is a hodgepodge of cop-thiller cliches. The protagonist is Matthew Scudder, played by Liam Neeson. Scudder is a recovering alcoholic and ex-cop. Scudder quit the force after gunning down the assailants in a fatal armed robbery. His superiors called him a hero and gave him a commendation. Scudder quit anyway. He quit drinking too. Later, we learn his actions weren't quite so heroic. It's supposed to be a revelation, but anyone who's seen more than a few cop movies will see it coming.

Scudder now makes his living as an unlicensed private investigator. He acquires a sidekick in the form of TJ, a street-smart homeless boy Scudder meets in the library. TJ has sickle-cell anaemia, a plot point that seems to exist both to engage our sympathy and to enable the improbable third act.

There's a tired sub-plot of the gruff ex-cop meeting the plucky street-kid and the street kid melting the ex-cop’s tough exterior. It goes nowhere and doesn't mesh with the rest of the plot which sees Scudder take the case of a drug trafficker who’s wife was kidnapped, raped, tortured and killed. The trail leads Scudder to a pair of horrific sociopaths who’ve been doing this for a long time.

As the movie wore on, I found myself getting more and more angry. The contempt for the audience's intelligence is galling.

There are lots of redundant scenes. The movie opens with one. Scudder sits in the car with his partner. The partner bemoans Scudder's drinking, saying he worries he can’t count on Scudder to have his back. Scudder gets out of the car and walks into a bar. It’s morning. He grabs a paper and sits down. Without a word the bartender brings Scudder a coffee and two shots of whiskey.

Why not just open with Scudder walking into the bar? The morning light, the lack of dialog, the coffee and two shots; they tell us everything we need to know. Not to mention we never see that partner again.

Later, when Scudder discovers some badly written romance fiction. He reads it aloud, even though the camera is looking at the page. This is a film that doesn’t even trust the audience to be able to read.

I wanted to like this movie, I really did. I love a good detective story, and the film even name-checks Sam Spade and Phillip Marlowe. But it follows that with a joke based on a dated football reference that wouldn't be funny even if it were current.

A few minutes on Wikipedia tells me that the film is a combination of several Matthew Scudder novels. Maybe the film tried to condense too many plot-points into a single movie, or maybe the books were just bad. Whatever the reason, it's pretty damning that Liam Neeson’s would-be New York accent is the least of this film's problems.
