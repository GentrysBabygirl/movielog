_Kingsman: The Secret Service_ is an adolescent male super-spy fantasy. It flirts with having something to say about elitism and class heirarchy, but thats all lost amid a swath of stylized cartoonish violence. That's not to say that any of this is a bad thing. If _Octopussy (1983_ ranks as one of your favorite James Bond films, _Kingsman: The Secret Service_ will be right up your alley.

The film opens with a boom box playing the opening notes of Dire Straights's _Money for Nothing_. The camera pans up. We're in the Afghanistan desert. A pair of gunship helicopters unload a series of missles into a fortified palace. Rubble falls to the ground only to spring back up to form the letters for the opening credits. 

The story is from a comic book series by Mark Millar, who also wrote the comic books series that _Wanted (2008)_ was based on. The two stories are similar. Here, a young boy growing up in the London projects, discovers his father was a super spy. He tries out for the ultra secret Kingsman organization. His mentor is Harry Hart, codename Galahad, played by Colin Firth.

Firth is an interesting choice. With someone like Clive Owen the film could have flirted with a more serious and cynical tone. But the juxtoposition of the mild mannered Firth and the comical violence leaves the film with nowhere to go but silly. There's even a scene between him and Samuel Jackson where they have a fine dinner of Big Macs that seems like it was added specifically for Firth, as he's the only actor I can imagine pulling that bit off.
