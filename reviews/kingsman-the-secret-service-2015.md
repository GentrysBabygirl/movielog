_Kingsman: The Secret Service_ tells the story of a young man named Gary who goes by Eggsy. We’re never told how or why he got this nickname. The film is full of cruft like this, but its easy to ignore.

Eggsy lives with his mother and infant sister in one of London’s seedier housing projects. His father died when he was just a toddler. These days his mother has taken up with a low level hood who bullies Eggsy and degrades his mother. 

A rare moment of defiance leads to Eggsy ending up in jail. When given his one phone call, Eggsy calls a mystery number his mother gave him should he ever find himself in trouble. Shortly after, Eggsy walks out of jail a free man. Outside the police station, Eggsy meets Harry Hart. 

Harry, played by Colin Firth, is a dapper gentleman cut from the David Niven cloth. The two go for a pint. Harry tells Eggsy that Eggsy’s father was actually a Kingsman, a member of an elite group of gentleman super-spies and that he died saving Harry’s life. Eggsy is incredulous. Harry goes on. He sees potential in Eggsy. Potential that’s being wasted. He offers Eggsy an opportunity. A chance to try out for the Kingsman.

And so Eggsy is off to spy-school. In keeping with the dapper gentlman theme, spy school is more like a posh boarding school than boot camp. In between practicing with sniper rifles and parachuting out of planes, the hopeful recruits dress something resembling flannel suit pajamas. 

Of course, every spy story needs a super villian. Here we’re given Richmond Valentine, played by Samuel L. Jackson. Valentine is an internet billionare who speaks with a lisp, hates the sight of blood, and dresses like a teenager. He plans to wipe out eighty-five percent of the human race in an effort to save the planet. Naturally, he’ll pick the fifteen percent that will survive.

And what would a spy villian be without a colorful henchman? Valentine has Gazelle, a double leg amputee whose prostetics double as swords capable of slicing a man in half. Spoiler alert: she slices someone in half.

As the film builds to the inevitable confrentation between Eggsy and Valentine, it becomes increasingly ludicrous. Harry single-handedly kills a church full of people. Heads explode in a rainbow spray of gore. It’s not a bad thing. The juxtoposition of the mild mannered Firth and the comical violence leaves the film with nowhere to go but silly. there's even a scene between him and Samuel Jackson where they have a fine dinner of Big Macs that seems like it was added specifically for Firth, as he's the only actor I can imagine pulling that bit off.

Casting Firth has its downsides, however.  With someone like Clive Owen, the film could have gone with a sligtly more serious and cynical tone. The script flirts with having something to say about elitism and class heirarchy, but its all lost amid the swath of stylized cartoonish violence.

As I eluded to earlier, the film is full of cruft. Whether its characters with no payoff, like Roxy, another Kingsman recruit who’s mostly forgotten in the film’s finale, or gaping plot holes, like how an ultra secret organization allows most of its recruiting class to walk away after failing to make the cut, there’s some sloppy storytelling going on here. But again, you’re hard-pressed to care given the film’s nature of constnatly one-upping the bit of over-the-top violence that came before.

And thus, in the end, _Kingsman: The Secret Service_ is nothing more than an adolescent male super-spy fantasy. That's not to say that its bad. If _Octopussy (1983)_ ranks as one of your favorite James Bond films, _Kingsman: The Secret Service_ will be right up your alley.
