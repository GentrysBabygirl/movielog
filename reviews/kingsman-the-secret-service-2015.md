_Kingsman: The Secret Service_ tells the story of a young man named Gary who goes by Eggsy. We’re never told how or why he got this nickname. The film is full of cruft like this, but its easy to ignore.

Eggsy lives with his mother and infant sister in one of London’s seedier housing projects. His father died when he was just a toddler. These days his mother has taken up with a low level hood who bullies Eggsy and degrades his mother. 

A rare moment of defiance leads to Eggsy ending up in jail. When given his one phone call, Eggsy calls a mystery number his mother gave him should he ever find himself in trouble. Shortly after, Eggsy walks out of jail a free man. Outside the police station, Eggsy meets Harry Hart. 

Harry, played by Colin Firth, is a dapper gentleman cut from the David Niven cloth. The two go for a pint. Harry tells Eggsy that Eggsy’s father was actually a Kingsman, a member of an elite group of gentleman super-spies and that he died saving Harry’s life. Eggsy is incredulous. Harry goes on. He sees potential in Eggsy. Potential that’s being wasted. He offers Eggsy an opportunity. A chance to try out for the Kingsman.

And so Eggsy is off to spy-school. In keeping with the dapper gentlman theme, spy school is more like a posh boarding school than boot camp. In between practicing with sniper rifles and parachuting out of planes, the hopeful recruits dress something resembling flannel suit pajamas. 

Of course, every spy story needs a super villian. Here we’re given Richmond Valentine, played by Samuel L. Jackson. Valentine is an internet billionare who speaks with a lisp, hates the sight of blood, and dresses like a teenager. He plans to wipe out eighty-five percent of the human race in an effort to save the planet. Naturally, he’ll pick the fifteen percent that will survive.

And what would a spy villian be without a colorful henchman? Valentine has Gazelle, a double leg amputee whose prostetics double as swords capable of slicing a man in half. Spoiler alert: she slices someone in half.

As the film builds to the inevitable confrentation between Eggsy and Valentine, it becomes increasingly ludicrous. Harry single-handedly kills a church full of people. Heads explode in a rainbow spray of gore.

Firth is an interesting choice. With someone like Clive Owen the film could have flirted with a more serious and cynical tone. But the juxtoposition of the mild mannered Firth and the comical violence leaves the film with nowhere to go but silly. There's even a scene between him and Samuel Jackson where they have a fine dinner of Big Macs that seems like it was added specifically for Firth, as he's the only actor I can imagine pulling that bit off.

In the end, _Kingsman: The Secret Service_ is an adolescent male super-spy fantasy. It flirts with having something to say about elitism and class heirarchy, but thats all lost amid a swath of stylized cartoonish violence. That's not to say that any of this is a bad thing. If _Octopussy (1983_ ranks as one of your favorite James Bond films, _Kingsman: The Secret Service_ will be right up your alley.

The film opens with a boom box playing the opening notes of Dire Straights's _Money for Nothing_. The camera pans up. We're in the Afghanistan desert. A pair of gunship helicopters unload a series of missles into a fortified palace. Rubble falls to the ground only to spring back up to form the letters for the opening credits. 

The story is from a comic book series by Mark Millar, who also wrote the comic books series that _Wanted (2008)_ was based on. The two stories are similar. Here, a young boy growing up in the London projects, discovers his father was a super spy. He tries out for the ultra secret Kingsman organization. His mentor is Harry Hart, codename Galahad, played by Colin Firth.
