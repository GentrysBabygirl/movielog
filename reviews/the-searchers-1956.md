_The Searchers_ is a very good film about a very flawed man.

The story opens three years after the Civil War.  John Wayne plays Ethan Edwards, a former Confederate soldier turned drifter who visits his brother’s family on the Texas frontier. 

Shortly after Ethan arrives, Comanches massacre his brother and sister-in-law. After the funeral, Ethan sets off in search of his young niece Debbie, whom the Comanche have taken captive. Accompanying Ethan is Martin Pawley, an orphan who Ethan’s brother and sister-in-law raised as their own.

Years pass as the two search. Director John Ford uses the gigantic mesas of Monument Valley to frame his characters as tiny and alone. Small specs on the vast, unforgiving landscape of the frontier. The trail goes cold. The pair catch a break. The trail goes cold again. Ethan’s hatred for the Comanche begins to consume him. In time, Martin realizes with growing horror that Ethan means to kill Debbie should they find her. Such is Ethan’s unbridled hate for the Comanche, that he can’t bear the thought of her having gone native.

The film isn’t all dark. During the breaks when the trail goes cold, Ethan and Martin return to a neighboring homestead. There, Martin and a young pioneer girl fumble at flirtation in a series of slapstick events. These bits can be jarring, but they exist to lighten the mood. Without them, the ending would feel disingenuous.

Putting aside these comedic interludes, this is Wayne’s movie. He gives a fearless performance. Consider his introduction. Disillusioned after losing the war, he is a man full of rage with no outlet. While he’s all smiles around his family, when he meets Martin he goes cold. Martin is one-eighth Comanche. Wayne’s character identifies him as ‘the other’ and his bitterness bubbles to the surface. In Ethan, Wayne inhabits a disenfranchised, bitter man. After battling on the losing side of a war, he longs for validation. In the Comanche he finds an outlet for his rage. A chance to redeem himself in his own mind.

But of course, he’s beyond redemption. The now-famous closing shot illustrates this perfectly. As everyone enters the house, Ethan remains standing outside. He shifts his weight and watches the emotional warmth inside before turning and walking back toward the frontier.

And it’s this refusal to judge or redeem Wayne’s character that makes _The Searchers_ resonate. While Ethan may have moments of compassion and heroism, the film doesn’t allow for a contrived finale wherein he is somehow cured of his bigotry. Nor does it paint him as a one-dimensional villain. Instead, we’re left to acknowledge Ethan’s nature and contemplate the role men like him played in the settling of the American West.
