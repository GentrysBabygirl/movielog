_Crave_ is the story of Aiden,  a timid, but likable man in his mid thirties. Aiden makes his living photographing Detroit's grisly crime scenes. Violence and decay surround him. 

To cope, Aiden escapes into a series of over-the-top fantasies. He sees two young men harassing an attractive woman on a train and dreams of shooting the men in the kneecaps and the crowd hailing him as a hero. A man talks over a speaker at an AA meeting and Aiden envisions pulping the man's skull with a sledgehammer as the group applauds. He begins to have trouble accepting his fantasies as illusion. He talks of feeling 'divergent' from reality. Soon, he acquires a gun.

Meanwhile, Aiden has also been fantasizing about his young neighbor, Virginia. She's got an unkempt boyfriend named Ravi who doesn't seem to treat her well. In an improbable (but charming) sequence, Aiden becomes his fantasy self and takes Virginia to bed. 

Flush with confidence, Aiden attempts to stop a pimp from beating a girl in the street. He is ineffectual and nearly killed.

Aiden sees more of Virginia. He falls hard. But Virginia soon senses Aiden's unstable nature and returns to Ravi. This leads to the inevitable meeting of Aiden, Ravi, and Aiden's gun.

The cinematography and performances are great. But, much like its protagonist, _Crave_ is a film unsure of itself. We see Aiden bumble through the world's most awkward blackmail attempt. We see him joke to Virginia that he's old enough to be her father in relation to their 13-year age gap. These and other bits are funny, but they don't gel with the film's darker, noir-ish tones. Were the filmmakers afraid that, without the jokes, the audience would still laugh at the material? Or is the film a comedy at heart and it's the darker material that takes itself too seriously? Whichever side you come down on, _Crave_ feels like a missed opportunity.
