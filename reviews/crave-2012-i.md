Aiden is a timid, single man in his mid thirties. He makes his living photographing Detroit's blood-soaked crime scenes. He is also losing his mind. 

On the train home, he sees two young men harassing an attractive woman. He fantasizes about shooting the men in the kneecaps and receiving oral sex from the grateful woman. He hears voices. He sits behind a loud-mouth at an AA meeting and envisions pulping the man's skull with a sledgehammer. He hears more voices. Soon, he acquires a gun.

Meanwhile, Aiden's also been fantasizing about his young neighbor, Virginia. She's got an unkempt boyfriend named Ravi who doesn't seem to treat her well. In an improbable but charming sequence of events, Aiden becomes his fantasy self and takes Virginia to bed. 

Flush with confidence, Aiden attempts to stop a pimp from beating a girl in the street. He is ineffectual and nearly killed.

Aiden sees more of Virginia. He falls hard. But Virginia soon senses Aiden's unstable nature and returns to Ravi. This leads to the inevitable meeting of Aiden, Ravi, and Aiden's gun.

The cinematography and performances are great. But, much like its protagonist, _Crave_ is a film unsure of itself. We see Aiden bumble through the world's most awkward blackmail attempt. We see him joke to Virginia that he's old enough to be her father in relation to their 13-year age gap. These and other bits are funny, but they don't gel with the film's darker, noirish tones. Were the filmmakers afraid that, without the jokes, the audience would still laugh at the material? Or is the film a comedy at heart and it's the darker material that takes itself too seriously? Whichever side you come down on, _Crave_ feels like a missed opportunity.
