Despite the title[^1] (and presence of Hammer regular Christopher Lee) _The Devil Rides Out_ plays more like an adventure film than a horror.

Lee plays the dashing Duke de Richleau a nobleman adventurer who, as the film opens, awaits the arrival of his good friend Rex Van Ryan. Rex arrives piloting his own biplane. He lands and the two set off to check in on a younger friend of theirs, Simon. Simon is the son of one of their fallen comrades, and the Duke and Rex have sworn to look after the boy. What they find upon arriving at Simon's palatial house, alarms the Duke. It seems Simon has fallen in with a group of Satanists lead by the sinsister Mocata, played by Charles Gray.

Worse still, it turns out that ? also known as the night the Devil Rides Out(see that?) is in three days, upon which Simon will receive his Satanic baptism and lose his soul forever. With the stakes set, the film rolls along as a suspenseful adventure. The Duke and Rex kidnap Simon but Mocata possesses Simon and forces him to return. The Duke and Rex go into detective mode, tracking Mocata through a young girl Rex met at Simon's house. The girl, Tanith is also an adept yet to be baptized. She serves as something of a love interest for Rex [^2].

Mocata posseses Tanith, forcing her to flee Rex. Rex tracks her to a woodland orgy where he and the Duke rescue Simon and Tanith from a visage of the devil himself. The four retreat to the Duke's niece's country estate, where Mocata lays a supernatural seige, conjuring visions and demons in an attempt to extract Simon and Tanith.

It’s the sort of film that has no business working. It helps that Hammer Films knew how to make a film _look_ expensive. The sets and props all belie the modest budget. But the script is pure pulp. Just look at the character names. Rex Van Ryan? Duke de Richleau? Mocata?

Richard Matheson’s screenplay is full of cringeworthy dialog. And yet, somehow, Lee and Gray make it work. Lee delivers a nobleman’s nobleman. No upper lip has ever been stiffer. Listening to his commentary on the DVD, its clear he was a big fan of the Dennis Wheatly source novel. His belief in the source material resonates in his performance, which is so earnest we can't help but buy it.

Opposite Lee, Gray is just as good. In a role that, on paper, would seem to be over-the-top, Gray gives a smooth performance every bit as icy as Lee's. Consider the scene where he calls on the Duke's niece in an attempt to extract the neophytes under thier protection. She makes to throw him out, but he leaves of his own accord saying, “I'm leaving.
I shall not be back... but something will.” He pauses for a moment then adds, “Tonight. Something will come for Simon and the girl.” He says it not in a threatening tone, but almost a matter-of-fact way that makes the line work.

, which, in turn, distracts from the sometimes rediculous dialog.

[^1]: Fearing it would be mistaken for a western, USA distributors Twentieth Century Fox changed the title to _The Devils’ Bride_ for it’s theatrical release.

[^2]: The script wisely keeps Lee aloof. Saddling him with a romantic subplot would have killed his nobleman of steel performance.
