Lee recommened the material to Hammer.
Rex’s voice is dubbed.
Hammer wanted another bond villian Gert Frobe.

Lee is suave.
Christopher Lee knows a lot about black magic.

“Simon is playing the most dangerous game known to mankind.”

John Hunter did a first pass on the script.

The year is 1929. Christopher Lee plays the dashing Duke de Richleau a nobleman adventurer who, as the film opens, awaits his good friend Rex Van Ryn. Rex arrives piloting his own biplane. He lands and the two set off to check in on their young friend, Simon. Simon is the son of their fallen comrade, and the Duke and Rex have sworn to look after the boy. What they find upon arriving at Simon's palatial house, alarms the Duke. It seems Simon has fallen in with a group of Satanists lead by the sinister Mocata, played by Charles Gray.

Worse still, the following night is the Grand Sabbat[^1], upon which Simon will receive his Satanic baptism and lose his soul forever. The Duke and Rex kidnap Simon and take him to the Duke’s manor. Mocata possesses Simon and forces him to return. The Duke and Rex go into detective mode, tracking Mocata through a young girl Rex met at Simon's house. The girl, Tanith is also awaiting her baptism. She serves as something of a love interest for Rex [^2].

Mocata posseses Tanith, forcing her to flee Rex. Rex tracks her to a woodland orgy where he and the Duke rescue Simon and Tanith from a visage of the devil himself. The four retreat to the Duke's niece's country estate. Mocata lays  seige, conjuring visions and demons in an attempt to extract Simon and Tanith.

It’s the sort of film that has no business working. It helps that Hammer Films knew how to make a film _look_ expensive. The sets and props all belie the modest budget. But the script is pure pulp with a lot of cringeworthy dialog [^3]. And yet, somehow, Lee and Gray make it work. Lee delivers a nobleman’s nobleman. No upper lip has ever been stiffer. Listening to his commentary on the DVD, it's clear he was a big fan of the Dennis Wheatly source novel. His belief in the source material resonates in his performance, which is so earnest we can't help but buy it.

Opposite Lee, Gray is just as good. In a role that, on paper, would seem to be over-the-top, Gray gives a smooth performance every bit as icy as Lee's. Consider the scene where he calls on the Duke's niece in an attempt to extract the neophytes under their protection. She makes to throw him out, but he leaves of his own accord saying, “I'm leaving. I shall not be back, but something will.” He pauses for a moment then adds, “Tonight. Something will come for Simon and the girl.” His tone isn't so much ominous as it is matter-of-fact, with just the slightest hint of excitement.

_The Devil Rides Out_ does a great job evoking the serial adventures that were popular during the era in which it's set[^4]. While he would star as the titular villian in both the Dracula and Fu Manchu franchises, after watching this movie, one is left wishing Hammer would have spawned a series featuring the Duke de Richleau. As it turned out, Lee would star in Hammer's next Wheatly adaptation, _To the Devil a Daughter (1976)_, but as the villian. 

Totally not true. They did The Lost Continent.

[^1]: The eve of May Day, also known as the night the devil rides out.

[^2]: In turn, Rex seems to exist soley for this subplot.

[^3]: I don't blame screenwriter Richard Matheson. He's just adapting the source material. Sure the dialog may stink, but how about those names? Rex Van Ryan? Duke de Richleau? Mocata? Great stuff.

[^4]: Twentieth Century Fox changed the title to _The Devils’ Bride_ for the USA theatrical release. They were afraid moviegoers would think _The Devil Rides Out_ was a western.
