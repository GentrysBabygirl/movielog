Despite the title[^1] and presence of Hammer regular Christopher Lee, _The Devil Rides Out_ plays more like an adventure film than a horror. 

Lee plays the dashing Duke de Richleau a nobleman adventurer who, as the film opens, awaits the arrival of his good friend Rex Van Ryan. Rex arrives piloting his own bi-plane. He lands in in a green field and the two set off to check in on a younger friend of theirs, Simon. Simon is the son of one of their fallen comrades, and the Duke and Rex have sworn to look after the boy. What they find upon arriving at Simon's palatial house, alarms the Duke. It seems Simon has fallen in with a group of Satanists lead by the sinsister Mocata, played by Charles Gray.

It turns out that ? also known as the night the Devil Rides Out(see that?) is in three days, upon which Simon will receive his Satanic baptism and lose his soul forever. There's some back and forth, wherein the Duke and Rex kidnap Simon, only to have Mocata possess Simon and force him to return. The Duke and Rex rescue Simon once again, along with a young girl named Tanith who serves as something of a love interest for Rex. 

Mocata then lays into a supernatural seige, conjuring visions and demons, in an attempt to extract Simon and Tanith. 

It’s the sort of film that has no business working. It’s pure pulp right down to the character names. Rex Van Ryan? Duke de Richleau? Mocata? Richard Matheson’s screenplay is full of cringeworthy dialog. And yet, somehow, Lee and Gray make it work. Lee delivers a nobleman’s nobleman. No upper lip has ever been stiffer. He conveys such authority in the part, that he _wills_ the lines to sound convincing. 

Gray is just as good. Instead of going over the top, Gray gives a smooth performance every bit as icy as Lee. Consider the scene where he calls on de Richleau’s niece in an attempt to extract the neophytes under de Richleau’s protection. She makes to throw him out, but he leaves of his own accord saying, “I'm leaving.
I shall not be back... but something will.” He pauses for a moment then adds, “Tonight. Something will come for Simon and the girl.” He says it not in a threatening tone, but almost a matter-of-fact sense that makes the line work.

It also helps that Hammer Films knew how to make a film _look_ expensive. The sets and props all belie the modest budget, which, in turn, distracts from the sometimes rediculous dialog. 

[^1]: Fearing it would be mistaken for a western, USA distributors Twentieth Century Fox changed the title to _The Devils’ Bride_ for it’s theatrical release.
