Despite the title[^1] and presence of Hammer regular Christopher Lee, _The Devil Rides Out_ plays more like an adventure film than a horror. Lee plays the dashing Duke de Richleau a nobleman adventurer who, along with his good friend Rex Van Ryan, battles a cult of Satanists who've attempted to recruit a young man in the Duke's charge. 

It’s the sort of film that has no business working. It’s pure pulp right down to the character names. Rex Van Ryan? Duke de Richleau? Mocata? Richard Matheson’s screenplay is full of cringeworthy dialog. And yet, somehow, Lee and Charles Gray opposite him as the cult leader, make it work. Lee delivers a nobleman’s nobleman. No upper lip has ever been stiffer. He conveys such authority in the part, that he _wills_ the lines to sound convincing. 

Gray is just as good. Instead of going over the top, Gray gives a smooth performance every bit as icy as Lee. Consider the scene where he calls on de Richleau’s niece in an attempt to extract the neophytes under de Richleau’s protection. She makes to throw him out, but he leaves of his own accord saying, “I'm leaving.
I shall not be back... but something will.” He pauses for a moment then adds, “Tonight. Something will come for Simon and the girl.” He says it not in a threatening tone, but almost a matter-of-fact sense that makes the line work.

It also helps that Hammer Films knew how to make a film _look_ expensive. The sets and props all belie the modest budget, which, in turn, distracts from the sometimes rediculous dialog.
