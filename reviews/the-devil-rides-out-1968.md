The year is 1929. Christopher Lee plays the dashing Duke de Richleau a nobleman adventurer who, as the film opens, awaits his good friend, Rex Van Ryn. Rex arrives piloting his own biplane. He lands and the two set out to check in on their young friend, Simon. What they find upon arriving at Simon's palatial house, alarms the Duke. It seems Simon has fallen in with a group of Satanists lead by the sinister Mocata, played by Charles Gray. As the Duke says, “Simon is playing the most dangerous game known to mankind.”

With dialog like that[^1], the film has no business working. And yet it does. It helps that Hammer Films knew how to make a film _look_ expensive. The sets and props all belie the modest budget. But the real credit goes to the film's two leads.

Lee's Duke de Richelau harkens back to Peter Cushing's turn as Van Helsing in _Horror of Dracula (1958)_. Both are gentleman adventerers with piercing gazes, steel resolves, and razor wits. Listening to Lee's DVD commentary, it's clear he was a big fan of the Dennis Wheatly novel [^2]. His belief in the source material resonates in his performance, which is so earnest we can't help but buy it.

Opposite Lee, Gray is just as good[^3]. In a role that, on paper, would seem to be over-the-top, Gray gives a smooth performance every bit as icy as Lee's. Consider the scene where he calls on the Duke's niece in an attempt to extract the neophytes under their protection. She makes to throw him out, but he leaves of his own accord saying, “I'm leaving. I shall not be back, but something will.” He pauses for a moment then adds, “Tonight. Something will come for Simon and the girl.” His tone isn't so much ominous as it is matter-of-fact, with just the slightest hint of excitement.

_The Devil Rides Out_ isn't a horror film[^4]. It's a thrilling adventure. Sure, the script is pure pulp, but between the terrific pace and the great performances from Lee and Gray, we're having too much fun to care.

[^1]: Lee brought the book to Hammer and insisted they make it into a film. Judging by the DVD commentary, he's also something of an expert on black magic.

[^2]: I don't blame screenwriter Richard Matheson (or John Hunter, who apparently did a first-draft of the script). He's just adapting the source material. Sure the dialog may stink, but how about those names? Rex Van Ryan? Duke de Richleau? Mocata? Great stuff.

[^3]: Gray had just starred in _You Only Live Twice (1967)_ but Hammer's first choice for Mocata was another Bond alumnus: Gert Frobe, Goldfinger himself!

[^4]: Twentieth Century Fox changed the title to _The Devils’ Bride_ for the USA theatrical release. They were afraid moviegoers would think _The Devil Rides Out_ was a western.
