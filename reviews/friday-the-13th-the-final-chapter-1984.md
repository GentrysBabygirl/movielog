_Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter_ picks up right where _Friday the 13th Part III (1982)_ leaves off[^1]. Jason, believed dead after being hanged in a barn after having suffered a hatchet to the face, is carted off to the morgue. Once there, he wakes up, dispatches some of the morgue staff, and heads back to Crystal Lake where he works his way through a house full of oversexed teens.

I was eight when this movie came out. Growing up in the 80’s, Jason was the king of the monsters. Freddy and Michael Myers were scary, sure, but not like Jason. Jason was _brutal_. 

Not that I saw any of the _Friday the 13th_ movies as a kid. Neither had any of my friends. So the films achieved a kind of mythical status. I can remember looking at the box covers at the video store. The white body outline holding the bloody knife or axe. I was sure these were the scariest movies ever made.

Thus, it’s with an odd sense of nostalgia that I’m drawn to the films now. They’re certainly not as scary as my young self would have me believe, but I’m also older and less sensitive to the violence. Still, there’s a fundamental draw that’s evidenced by the Jason’s enduring popularity.

I think it’s because, on a really morbid level, the film’s work as a black comedy. By this point the series had established a working formula. Titillate the audience via some horny teens, then have Jason off someone in a gruesomely over-the-top fashion[^2]. Once you understood the formula, you began to anticipate the kill scenes. As the series went on, the filmmakers had to dream up more exotic kills, and part of the fun comes in guessing just how Jason was going to take out a particular character. 

To that end, this is the best sequel of the series yet. The cast of potential victims is amiable enough. Especially a young Crispin Glover, whose dancing scene almost single-handedly makes the film worth a look. This entry also diversifies the victim stock by including an adult, a first for the series.

This entry also features the best atmosphere since the original film, with a nice rain storm pounding down during the big finale. 

Now, _Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter_ isn’t going to convert anyone who hates the slasher genre. But genre fans will appreciate the better-than-average performances and creative kills. That is has the most nudity of any entry in the series up to that point, probably doesn’t hurt either.

[^1]: The first four films happen back-to-back, taking place over the course of four days. Only the first two films actually occurred (at least in part) on Friday the 13th. This entry starts the night of Sunday the 15th, and ends on Tuesday the 17th. This proves to be something of a problem, however. See, one of the characters is out to avenge his dead sister, who Jason killed in the second film. This character has all kinds of newspaper clippings about Jason that he’s been compiling since his sister died. Except, by the film’s timeline, his sister died less than 48 hours ago. 

[^2]: The _Friday the 13th_ films are far from the only horror movies to do this. One of _Alien (1979)_’s best scares comes after the camera lingers on a wall full of posters of nude women.
