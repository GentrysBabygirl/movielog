_Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter_ picks up right where _Friday the 13th Part III (1982)_ leaves off[^1]. Jason, believed dead after having suffered a hatchet to the face and being hanged in a barn, is carted off to the morgue. Once there, he wakes up, dispatches some of the morgue staff, and heads back to Crystal Lake.

By this point the series had established a working formula. Titillate the audience via some horny teens, then have Jason off someone in a gruesomely over-the-top fashion[^2]. To that end, this is the best sequel of the series yet. 

The cast of potential victims is amiable enough. Especially a young Crispin Glover, whose dancing scene almost single-handedly makes the film worth a look. This entry also diversifies the victim stock by including a single mother who had the misfortune of owning the house next door to a house full of oversexed teens.

This entry also features the best atmosphere since the original film, with a nice rain storm pounding down during the big finale. 

Now, _Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter_ isn’t going to convert anyone who disliked the first three films. But genre fans will appreciate the better-than-average performances and creative kills. That is has the most nudity of any entry in the series up to that point, probably doesn’t hurt either.


[^1]: Fun bit of trivia. The first four films happen back-to-back, taking place over the course of four days. Only the first two films actually occurred (at least in part) on Friday the 13th. This entry starts the night of Sunday the 15th, and ends on Tuesday the 17th. This proves to be something of a problem when character shows up tracking Jason. Jason killed his sister in the second film. He’s got all kinds of newspaper clippings and research. Except, by the film’s timeline, his sister died less than 48 hours ago. 

[^2]: The _Friday the 13th_ films are far from the only horror movies to do this. One of _Alien (1979)_’s best scares comes after the camera lingers on a wall full of posters of nude women.
