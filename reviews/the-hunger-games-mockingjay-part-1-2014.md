Full disclosure: I haven't seen the first _Hunger Games_ films, nor have I read the books.

That said, the film did an admirable job of bringing me up to speed. This entry takes place shortly after the end of the second film. Our herioine, #{} has just destroyed the titular Hunger Games and escaped courtesy of the rebel forces. The rebels were unable to rescue her true love Peta, who's now in the clutches of the evil --Empire-- Capital.

For the next hour and a half #{} frets about Peta, boards a ship, walks through some rubble, visits her now deserted family house, shoots some propeganda commericals, frets about Peta, boards a ship, walks through some more rubble, shoots a CGI plane out of the sky with a bow and arrow, frets about Peta, boards a ship, walks through some ruble we've already seen, visits the deserted family house again, frets about Peta, sees a CGI moose, walks through some more rubble, and frets about Peta. After about an hour and a half of this there's a ten minute rescue sequence.

This is a movie that has no reason to exist outside of gouging fans of the series for the cost of two tickets versus one to see the final chapter. Watching it felt like looking at the deleted scenes from a better movie where things actually happen. About halfway through I realized I could leave now and none of the characters would have progressed anymore by the film's end. Sticking it out to the end and realizing I was right brought me no satisfaction.

At the very least, if you're going to make a filler picture, at least make it short. At just over two hours, this is inexcusable. Did we really need so many shots of landing bay doors opening?

It might be something if the film weren't so cartoonish. A meditation on #{} being caught as pawn between the two forces vieying for control could be interesting if it weren't so black and white. The capital is evil and the rebels are good. Imagine how bad Star Wars would be if it focused on polotics instead of sci-fi action. Oh wait, we don't have to imagine, there's the whole prequel triology to show us.

But I'm getting sidetracked. _HGMJ_ is a non-movie. Unless you're the kind of person who has to watch every deleted scene and extended edition, Those that enjoyed the series first two installments can safely skip straight to the real finale in _HGMJ part 2.
