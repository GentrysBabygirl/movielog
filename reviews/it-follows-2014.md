_It Follows_ is the perfect horror film for folks who dismiss the genre as a step or two above pornography. It's well-produced, self-aware, and devoid of any disturbing scares or gratuitous thrills. 

The story opens at dusk with a girl fleeing her suburban home. Half dressed (but not nude) and wearing high heels, she runs into the street, looking back at her house. Her eyes are wide. She pauses, then runs back toward her house. Her father steps outside and asks if she's okay. She says she is as she runs back inside. A moment later, she's back out. She gets into her car, backs out of the driveway, and speeds out of her neighborhood and into the darkness.

She stops at a lake and walks down to the water. With the water at her back, she sits down and waits for her pursuer. While she waits, she makes a tearful call to her parents. She apologizes for past transgressions and says she loves them.

Cut to the next morning. The girl lies dead on the beach, her body twisted in a grotesque angle.

This scene is part of why the film doesn't work, but we'll get to that later.

Next we meet our protagonist, Jay. She's a nice girl, living in suburban Detroit. She's got a younger sister, and a couple of other friends that make up her social circle. She's been dating a guy named Hugh that she's pretty sweet on. 

Jay and Hugh go to the movies[^1], but leave when Hugh catches sight of a woman in a yellow dress. Jay doesn't see her, but a shaken Hugh insists they leave.

Later that night, Jay has sex with Hugh in the backseat of his car. It's their first time together. Afterwards, Jay lies in the backseat talking while Jay fumbles around in the trunk. He finds what he's looking for and climbs back into the car behind her. Hugh cuts Jay off mid-sentence by covering her mouth with a rag. Jay struggles, but soon passes out.

Jay wakes up tied to a wheelchair in a desolate, graffiti-covered parking garage. Hugh is pacing behind her, his eyes darting around. "You're not going to believe me," he begins, "but I need to you to remember what I'm saying."

Hugh tells her something is now following her. It doesn't run, but it's always walking in a straight line right toward her. If it touches her, she's dead. It can look like anyone. Someone she knows or a complete stranger. It's a curse. Someone gave it to him, and now, by having sex with her, he's given it to her. If the thing gets her, it goes after Hugh again, then right down the line to wherever it started. The best thing she can do now, Hugh says, is to have sex with someone else and pass the curse on.

To prove his point, he wheels her to the edge of the garage. Looking down into the overgrown lot, Jay can see a half-naked woman shambling toward the garage. Hugh waits until the thing enters the garage and is almost on top of them before wheeling Jay out and to his car. They peel out, leaving the thing behind. 

Hugh dumps Jay on her front lawn, still half-dressed where her sister and friends find her.

These scenes are another part of why the film doesn't work, but again, we'll get to that later.

The thing soon comes for Jay at her house. It turns out to be invisible to those not cursed, so her friends are little help as an early warning system. Jay flees to a park.

From there, her and her friends retreat to a neighbor's lake house, but the thing catches up with them. Despite being invisible, the thing manhandles Jay's friends when they try and stop it. 

Once again, Jay flees. The film breaks the narrative circle by having Jay crash her car in a cornfield. It's the same tired trope of the girl tripping while fleeing the monster. She wakes up in a hospital. Realizing she's in danger, but too injured to leave, Jay has sex with her neighbor and passes on the curse. The neighbor turns out to be pretty dim-witted. The thing gets him in a matter of days. Jay flees again and ends up passing the curse to a pair of random strangers.

The strangers don't last long either, likely because Jay either doesn't warn them or they just don't believe her. Either way, it's soon back after Jay, but this time her and her friends have a plan. 

The go to the local indoor pool, where Jay waits in the center of the water. Around the edges, they've placed various electrical items. The plan seems to be to electrocute the apparition[^2]. After some tense waiting, the thing shows up, but is reluctant to enter the water. Instead, it throws things at Jay. One of her friends produces a handgun. He fires blind at where the creature might be. He wings another of her friends before putting a bullet right in the creature's head. The thing falls into the pool, and tries to drag Jay under before it dies, ending the curse.

But, of course, it doesn't end. And neither does the film. Instead, Jay has sex with another of her friends. The ambiguous final shot sees the two walking hand-in-hand while someone that might be the creature approaches from behind. 

To be fair, this is a well-produced film dripping with atmosphere. The suburban locales evoke lived-in feel, while the Detroit cityscape reeks of urban decay. There's no hyper-kinetic editing or gimmicky found-footage. It's a slow burn. Well, maybe more like a slow singe. Given the script, I'm not sure this film could have been done any better.

But about that script.

Remember how I said this movie doesn't work? Let's talk about that.

The problems start with the opening sequence. Consider what it would have been like, had we not seen what happened to the girl waiting by the lake.  Only those cursed can see the creature, thus, the script could have played with the concept of the unreliable narrator. Is the curse real, or is Jay having some sort of breakdown. By showing the girl dead in a manner that required super-human strength, the film loses any ambiguity. The curse is real.

Continuing the too-much-information trend, the film then explains all the details of the curse. 

Rule #1 of horror: Nothing is scarier than the unknown. By establishing rules and limitations, the filmmakers have made the curse less scary. To borrow the film's STD metaphor, it's less like AIDS in the 1980's and more like Herpes today. 

Which leads me to the biggest problem of all. Yes this is horrible curse, but it's manageable. Hell, the film even seems to admit as much. If the thing just walks, then couldn't one just fly to someplace like Australia? Judging by the pool incident it doesn't like water, which means it probably can't swim, which means you're safe. 

And while we're on the subject of nit-picks, I'm not sure when this film is set, but how do these kids not have internet access? Wouldn't they search online for information about the curse? 

In the end, _It Follows_ offers little genuine horror. Nor does it offer anything in the way of vicarious thrills. Its attempts to subvert slasher tropes only reinforcing their value. Without them, there's nothing to distract us from whatâ€™s otherwise a trite premise.
