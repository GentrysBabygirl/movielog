_It Follows_ is a well-produced film with an original, puritanical concept and good performances. It's devoid of gratuitous thrills and unsettling insights into the human condition. It's the perfect horror film for folks who consider the genre to be one step above pornography.

The story opens at dusk with a girl fleeing her suburban home. Half dressed (but not nude) and wearing high heels, she runs into the street, looking back at her house. Her eyes are wide. She pauses, then runs back toward her house. Her father steps outside and asks if she's okay. She assures him that she is, as she runs back inside. A moment later, she's back out. She gets into her car, backs out of the driveway, and speeds out of her neighborhood and into the darkness.

She stops at a lake, walks down to the water, turns, sits down and waits for her pursuer. While she waits, she makes a tearful call to her parents, apologizing for past transgressions and assuring them that she loves them.

Cut to the next morning. The girl lies dead on the beach, her body twisted in a grotesque angle.

This scene is part of why the film doesn't work, but we'll get to that later.

Next we meet our protagonist, Jay. She's a nice girl, living in suburban Detriot. She's got a younger sister, and a couple of other friends that make up her social circle. She's been dating a guy named Hugh that she's pretty sweet on. 

Jay and Hugh go to the movies[^1], but leave before the show stars when Hugh catches sight of a woman in a yellow dress. Jay doesn't see her, but a shaken Hugh insists they leave.

Later that night, Jay has sex with Hugh in the backseat of his car. It's their first time together. Afterwards, Jay lies in the backseat talking while Jay fumbles around in the trunk. He finds what he's looking for and climbs back into the car behind her. He cuts her off mid-sentence by covering her mouth with a rag. Jay struggles, but soon passes out.

Jay wakes up tied to a wheelchair in a desloate, grafitte-covered parking garage. Hugh is there, pacing furtively. "You're not going to believe me," he begins, "but I need to you to remember what I'm saying."

Hugh then goes on to tell her something is now following her. It doesn't run, but it's always walking in a straight line right toward her. If it touches her, she's dead. It can look like anyone. Someone she knows or a complete stranger. Someone gave it to him, and now, by having sex with her, he's given it to her. If the thing gets her, it starts going after Hugh again, then right down the line to wherever it started. The best thing she can do now, he says, is to have sex with someone else and pass the curse on.

To prove his point, he wheels her to the edge of the garage. Looking down into the overgrown lot, Jay can see a half-naked woman shambling toward the garage. Hugh waits until the thing enters the garage and is nearly on top of them before wheeling Jay out and to his car. He dumps her on her front lawn, still half-dressed where her sister and friends find her.

These scenes are another part of why the film doesn't work, but again, we'll get to that later.

The rest of the film sees Jay try to avoid the mysterious follower. It turns out that only people who have been cursed can see the thing, so her friends are little help as far as an early warning system.

They retreat to a neighbor's lake house, but the thing catches up with them. Despite being invisible, the thing manhandles Jay's friends when they try and stop it. Jay flees, only to crash in a cornfield and end up in the hospital. Trapped in the hospital, Jay has sex with her neighbor and passes on the curse. The neighbor turns out to be pretty dim-witted and the thing gets him. Jay flees and ends up passing the curse to a pair of random strangers.

The strangers don't last long either, likely because Jay either doesn't warn them or they just don't believe her. Either way, the thing's soon back after Jay, but this time her and her friends come up with a plan.
