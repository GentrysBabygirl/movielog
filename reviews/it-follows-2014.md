_It Follows_ is a well-produced film with an original, puritanical concept and good performances. It's devoid of gratuitous thrills and unsettling insights into the human condition. It's the perfect horror film for folks who consider the genre to be one step above pornography.

The story opens at dusk with a girl fleeing her suburban home. Half dressed (but not nude) and wearing high heels, she runs into the street, looking back at her house. Her eyes are wide. She pauses, then runs back toward her house. Her father steps outside and asks if she's okay. She assures him that she is, as she runs back inside. A moment later, she's back out. She gets into her car, backs out of the driveway, and speeds out of her neighborhood and into the darkness.

She stops at a lake and walks down to the water. With the water at her back, she sits down and waits for her pursuer. While she waits, she makes a tearful call to her parents. She apologizes for past transgressions and assuring them that she loves them.

Cut to the next morning. The girl lies dead on the beach, her body twisted in a grotesque angle.

This scene is part of why the film doesn't work, but we'll get to that later.

Next we meet our protagonist, Jay. She's a nice girl, living in suburban Detroit. She's got a younger sister, and a couple of other friends that make up her social circle. She's been dating a guy named Hugh that she's pretty sweet on. 

Jay and Hugh go to the movies[^1], but leave when Hugh catches sight of a woman in a yellow dress. Jay doesn't see her, but a shaken Hugh insists they leave.

Later that night, Jay has sex with Hugh in the backseat of his car. It's their first time together. Afterwards, Jay lies in the backseat talking while Jay fumbles around in the trunk. He finds what he's looking for and climbs back into the car behind her. Hugh cuts Jay off mid-sentence by covering her mouth with a rag. Jay struggles, but soon passes out.

Jay wakes up tied to a wheelchair in a desolate, graffiti-covered parking garage. Hugh is pacing behind her, his eyes darting around. "You're not going to believe me," he begins, "but I need to you to remember what I'm saying."

Hugh then goes on to tell her something is now following her. It doesn't run, but it's always walking in a straight line right toward her. If it touches her, she's dead. It can look like anyone. Someone she knows or a complete stranger. It's a curse. Someone gave it to him, and now, by having sex with her, he's given it to her. If the thing gets her, it starts going after Hugh again, then right down the line to wherever it started. The best thing she can do now, Hugh says, is to have sex with someone else and pass the curse on.

To prove his point, he wheels her to the edge of the garage. Looking down into the overgrown lot, Jay can see a half-naked woman shambling toward the garage. Hugh waits until the thing enters the garage and is nearly on top of them before wheeling Jay out and to his car. They peel out, leaving the thing behind. 

Hugh dumps Jay on her front lawn, still half-dressed where her sister and friends find her.

These scenes are another part of why the film doesn't work, but again, we'll get to that later.

The thing soon comes for Jay at her house. It turns out that only people who have the curse can see the thing, so her friends are little help as far as an early warning system. Jay flees to a park.

From there, her and her friends retreat to a neighbor's lake house, but the thing catches up with them. Despite being invisible, the thing manhandles Jay's friends when they try and stop it. 

Once again, Jay flees. The film breaks the narrative circle by having Jay crash her car in a cornfield. It's the same tired trope of the girl tripping while fleeing the monster. She wakes up in a hospital. Realizing she's in danger, but too injured to leave, Jay has sex with her neighbor and passes on the curse. The neighbor turns out to be pretty dim-witted. The thing gets him in a matter of days. Jay flees again and ends up passing the curse to a pair of random strangers.

The strangers don't last long either, likely because Jay either doesn't warn them or they just don't believe her. Either way, the thing's soon back after Jay, but this time her and her friends come up with a plan. 

The go to the local indoor pool, where Jay waits in the center of the water. Around the edges, they've placed various electrical items. The plan seems to be to electrocute the apparition.[^2] After a bit the thing does show up, but is reluctant to enter the water. Instead, it starts throwing the various things at Jay. One of her friends produces a handgun. He fires at where the creature might be, winging another of her friends in the process before finally putting a bullet right in the creature's head. The thing falls into the pool, and tries to drag Jay under before it dies.

But, of course, it doesn't die. And neither does the film end. Instead, Jay has sex with another of her friends. The ambiguous ending sees the two walking hand in hand down the street, possibly aware of the creature looming behind them.

As I said this is a well-produced and well-acted film. The suburban locals bring to mind a less idlyic and more lived-in feel than the grandfather of suburban horror _Halloween (1979)_, rendering them even more relatable. The film bucks the trend of POV found-footage or hyper kenetic jump-cuts and opts for an atmospheric slow-burn. Given the script, I'm not sure this film could have been done any better.

But about that script.

Remember how I said this movie doesn't work? Let's talk about that.

The problems start early. Like the first sequence early. By showing the girl dead the following morning in a manner that required super-human strength to execute, the film loses any ambiguity regarding the nature of the curse. There's no question, it's real. Part of the concept is that only the cursed can see the thing that's following them, and thus, if you left some room for doubt, you could play with the concept of the unreliable narrator. 

Continuing the trend of too-much-information, the film then explains all the details of the curse. This diminishes the effect because nothing is scarier than the unknown. By establishing rules and limitations, the filmmakers have made the curse less scary. To borrow the film's STD metaphor, it's less like AIDS in the 1980's and more like Herpes today. 
Which leads me to the biggest problem of all. Yes this is horribe curse, but it's manageable. Hell, the film even addresses my first thought, and seems to admit that it would work. If the thing just walks, then just go to Europe or Spain or, perhaps best of all, Austrailia. Judging by the pool incident it doesn't like water which means it probably can't swim, which means you're safe. 

But while we're on the subject of nit-picks, I'm not sure when this film is supposed to be set, but how do these kids not have internet access? Wouldn't one of the first things be to try and find some more information on the curse? 

In the end, _It Follows_ isn’t scary enough to take seriously. Nor does it offer anything in the way of vicarious thrills. It attempts to subvert the slasher genre conventions, but if anything, it only re-inforces how importent those tropes are when it comes to covering up what’s otherwise a trite premise.




[^1]: In a nice bit of foreshadowing, the movie playing is _Charade (1963)_.

[^2]: Putting aside the logic of electricuting a semi-invisiable monster, what kind of pool wouldn't have GFE wiring that would prevent this from working?
