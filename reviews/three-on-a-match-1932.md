_Three on a Match_ is a great example of the crazy pre-code exploitation pictures that Hollywood produced in the early 1930's. 

The story begins in the fall of 1919. The film sets the time frame with what's now a common device, a montage of newspaper headlines.  Jack Dempsey wins the world heavyweight title. Prohibition passes. Woman's suffrage passes. Then, a smaller article. The New York City schools are set to reopen after summer vacation.

Cut to Public School 64. The camera pans back to reveal a school yard teaming with children. Hundreds streaming about. Were they not twirling about and playing on slides and swings it would pass for a prison yard. Here we meet three girls all age ten or so. 

Mary is something of a carefree tomboy. She doesn't mind that her bloomers are showing while she's playing on the swing or the attention it gets from some of the boys. This is much to the chagrin of class-beauty Vivian. When Mary skips class to smoke cigarettes with some boys, Vivian wants to tell on her, she's dissuaded by studious Ruth.

Time passes with more headlines. The girls are set to graduate. Ruth is valedictorian. Vivian is voted most popular. Mary might not be allowed to stand with her class at all, she's been in so much trouble.

After the ceremony, Ruth and Vivian talk about their futures. Ruth, her family unable to afford her going to high school, is off to secretarial school so that she might get a job. Vivian, with her wealthy family, is off to an exclusive boarding school. They both wonder what will become of Mary.

More time passes. It's 1925 now. The girls are teenagers. Mary, now played by Joan Blondell, has ended up at the state reform school. Vivian, now played by Anne Dvorak is reading lewd romance novels to her rapt roommates in Miss Jasons School for Young Ladies. Ruth, now played by Bette Davis, is toiling away in secretarial school.

Now it's 1930. We see Mary in a beauty parlor getting her hair done. She's telling her beautician that she ran into Ruth earlier that day and that the two hadn't seen each other since their days at Public School 64. It happens that Vivian is at the same beauty parlor and overhear's Mary's mention of Public School 64. Reunited, three women meet for lunch.

Something I love about the picture of this era. They usually ran just over an hour, so they had to be efficient. Here, they deliver ten years of backstory and characterization in under five minutes. 

At lunch, the girls catch up. We learn Mary has turned her life around and is now an actress who’s just gotten her first break. Ruth is working as a secretary. Vivian has married a wealthy lawyer, and has a three-year-old son. Mary and Ruth envy Vivian. But Vivian is restless and bored with her life. 

Later, talks her husband, Robert, into letting her travel with their son to Europe. Her husband reluctantly agrees. The night they're set to sail, he sees her off. After he leaves, Vivian runs into Mary, who’s recently been catapulted into stardom. She's there seeing another friend off. Vivian has the ship's stewardess watch her son, while she joins Mary's party. There she gets close to a young rake named Michael. The two drink and flirt. Michael asks her to leave with him. Vivian agrees. Before the ship leaves port, Vivian takes her son and debarks with Michael. 

From here, Vivian descends into a drug and alcohol fueled nightmare. We see her strung out on the sofa, while her son, dirty and unwashed, begs for some healthy food. 

Mary, feeling responsible, visits Robert and tells him where Vivian is holed up. Robert reclaims his son and divorces Vivian.  Mary and Robert grow closer. On the day his divorce is final, he asks Mary to become his wife. Mary agrees. Ruth joins the family as a nanny.

In between, we have the obligatory pre-code shot of a woman putting on her stockings, in this case Bette Davis.

Meanwhile, Vivian has continued her fall from grace. Michael turns out to be a gambler and the two are now desperate for money to feed their habits. Vivian, waiting outside the very uptown apartment building she used to call home, begs Mary for money. After they burn through that, Michael tries extorting Robert. When that doesn’t work, Michael kidnap’s Robert’s son. 

Unfortunately for all involved, Robert owes money to a mobster named Ace, played by Edward Arnold. Ace gets wind of the plot and muscles his way in via his henchman Harve, played by Humphrey Bogart. When the heat starts to close in, Harve leans on Michael to off the kid. Vivian, in a moment of lucidity in her withdrawal haze, saves her son in a startling (and over the top) fashion.  

It’s a lot of plot for 63 minutes of running time. This is a good thing. Things move so fast we’re not given much time to consider the insanity. Despite featuring later taboos like drug use, a man and woman living together out of wedlock, and something of a mixed-message regarding the worth of a good education, the film is resoundingly moral. Joseph Breen[^1] might not have liked the delivery, but he likely loved the message.
