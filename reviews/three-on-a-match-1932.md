_Three on a Match_ is a great example of the crazy pre-code exploitation pictures that Hollywood 
produced in the early 1930's. 

The story begins in the fall of 1919. The film sets the time frame with what's now a common device, a montage of newspaper headlines.  Jack Dempsey wins the world heavywieght title. Prohibition passes. Woman's suffrage passes. Then, a smaller article. The New York City schools are set to reopen after summer vacation..

Cut to Public School 64. The camera pans back to reveal a school yard teaming with children. Hundreds streaming about. Were they not twirling about and playing on slides and swings it would pass for a prison yard. Here we meet three girls all age ten or so. 

Mary is something of a carefree tomboy. She doesn't mind that her bloomers are showing while she's playing on the swing or the attention it gets from some of the boys. This is much to the chagrin of class-beauty Vivian. When Mary skips class to smoke cigarettes with some boys, Vivian wants to tell on her, she's disuaded by studious Ruth.

Time passes with more headlines. The girls are set to graduate. Ruth is valadictorian. Vivian is voted most popualr. Mary might not be allowed to stand with her class at all, she's been in so much trouble.

After the ceremony, Ruth and Vivian talk about their futures. Ruth, her family unable to afford her going to high school, is off to secretarial school so that she might get a job. Vivian, with her wealthy family, is off to an exclusive boarding school. They both wonder what will become of Mary.

More time passes. It's 1925 now. The girls are teenagers. Mary, now played by Joan Blondell, has ended up at the state reform school. Vivian, now played by Anne Dvorak is reading lewd romance novels to her rapt roomates in Miss Jasons School for Young Ladies. Ruth, now played by Bette Davis, is toiling away in secretarial school.

Now it's 1930. We see Mary in a beauty parlor getting her hair done. She's telling her beautician that she ran into Ruth earlier that day and that the two hadn't seen each other since their days at Public School 64. It happens that Vivian is at the same beauty parlor and overhear's Mary's mention of Public School 64. Reunited, three women meet for lunch.

Something I love about these pictures. They usually ran just over an hour, so they had to be efficient. Here, they delivery, ten years of backstory and characterization in under five minutes. 

At lunch, the girls catch up. We learn Mary has turned her life around and is now a struggling actress. Ruth is working as a secretary. Vivian has married a wealthy lawyer, and has a young son. Mary and Ruth envy Vivian. But Vivian is restless and bored with her life. She talks her husband into letting her travel with their son to Europe. Her husband reluctantly agrees. The night they're set to sail, he sees her off. After he leaves, Vivian runs into Mary, now a successful actress. She's there seeing another friend off. Vivian has the ship's steward watch her son, while she joins Mary's party. She drinks and flirts with a young rake named ?. Then, before the ship can leave port, she takes her son and deboards with ?. 

Flash forward ? weeks. Vivian's husband is distraught over her disappearance. Not so much for her, but for the boy.

Cut to the inside of a shabby apartment. Vivivan lies strung out on the sofa, while a dirty ? begs her for some food. The extent of her neglect makes ? uncomfortable 







Synopsis: A woman (Ann Dvorak) married to a successful lawyer with a young son, runs off with her childhood friend's (Joan Blondell) grifter boyfriend.

Three on a Match is one of those great pre-code Hollywood drama's that tells a refreshingly dark story without any sugarcoating.

Ann Dvorak plays a well-off woman bored with her married life. Through a chance meeting with an old childhood friend she winds up running off with a small time grifter, taking her young son with her. She parties to excess, and maybe even picks up a drug habit, all the while neglecting her son, who has to beg her for food. Unfortunately, her new man owes money to a mob boss—played wonderfully by Edward Arnold—who makes it clear that if he isn't paid soon, his enforcer—played by Humphrey Bogart, in a small part—will extract it in pain. Faced with this, Dvorak's character and her boyfriend hatch a kidnapping plot involving her son.

In-between all this there's a sub plot involving Dvorak's character's childhood friends—played by Joan Blondell and Bette Davis—meant to illustrate how much these characters have change, or not, since their youth. 

The great thing about Three on a Match is that all of this is crammed into only 63 minutes of running time. Things move along at a breakneck pace, and the plot, free of the Motion Picture Code's later trappings, feels remarkable fresh and honest. This, combined with the great cast (excluding Buster Phelps, who's just annoying as Ann Dvorak's character's kid) makes for a very entertaining experience.
