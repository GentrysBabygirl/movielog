Starting off in a rural barn, we see a young mother clutching a swaddled baby. It's dark and pouring outside. Her husband has the car's hood up, trying to get it started. An older boy looks at them both with a worried look. A monotone voice on the radio implores people to remain in their homes after dark. There's some voiceover narration by the boy, and then the family dog takes off into the rainy darkness outside. The boy follows. At this point, we can almost count the horror tropes. Indeed, _Stake Land_ doesn't start well.

It gets better. It seems the world is now overrun by the undead. The boy, Martin, meets Mister, an enigmatic loner who seems to know everything about killing vampires. Mister even pulls the fangs out of his kills and saves them like scalps. This little quirk may be the only reason the film uses vampires instead of zombies. 
Anyway, Mister takes Martin under his wing and the two set out for New Eden, a fabled promised land to the north. Standing in their way is a white supremacist cult that uses vampires as kind of a chemical weapon. 

After the shaky opening, the film plays well as a post-apocalyptic horror. It's dark, but not without some nice touches of black comedy. The solid production values and performances belie the film's all but straight-to-video release. Sure, the voiceover narration is unnecessary, but it's easy enough to ignore. Now if only they could have somehow gotten Warren Oates to play Mister...
