The western genre isn't dead. _Stake Land_ is a prime example.

The film is set in a near-future where vamps (a kind of fast-running-zombie/vampire hybrid) have overrun the world. The story follows Mister, an enigmatic vamp hunter who rescues orphaned teen Martin. The two head north in Mister's old Cadillac for the fabled town of New Eden.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Along the way they encounter the last visages of civilization in the form of barricaded frontier towns. They also cross The Brotherhood, a white supremacist cult that preaches that vampires are God's tool to purify the earth. 

Instead of the bandits or hostile natives of the classic westerns, we have vamps. There's a grisly opening sequence where we see a vamp drain and discard the corpse of an infant. But after that, _Stake Land_ keeps its baddies off-screen as much as possible. Like the best westerns, its content to let the scenery establish atmosphere. 

We see deserted strip malls. Desolate two-land blacktops. Overgrown buildings. Rusted scrapheaps. An urban wilderness.




Opening a rural barn, we see a young mother clutching a swaddled baby. It's dark and pouring outside. Her husband has the car's hood up, trying to get it started. An older boy looks at them both with a worried look. A monotone voice on the radio implores everyone to remain in their homes after dark. The family dog takes off into the rainy darkness outside and the boy follows.

At this point, I was regretting my decision to watch _Stake Land_. Haven't we all seen some variation of this scene before? Helpless family, looming evil, convenient plot device? Fortunately, things get better.

Outside, the boy meets Mister, an enigmatic loner. Think Warren Oates with a dash of Clint Eastwood. Mister tells the boy his family is already dead. The boy accepts this with wisdom seldom seen in a horror film. Two two creep back into the barn. Mister's flashlight finds the remains of the boy's mother and father. 

It seems the world is now overrun by vamps--a kind of fast-running-zombie/vampire hybrid. 

Back in the barn, Mister hears a noise and turns the light upward. In the loft, a vamp is sucking on the baby's corpse. It's a grisly but effective visual.

Mister kills the vamp. Mister seems to know everything about killing vamps. Mister even pulls the fangs out of his kills and saves them like scalps. 

Mister takes the boy, Martin, under his wing. The two set out in Mister's old Cadillac for New Eden, a fabled promised land to the north. 


They pass through a series of barricaded frontier towns that represent what's left of American civilization. 

In time, Martin, Mister and the nun find themselves ambushed and taken prisoner by a white supremacist cult. The cult preaches that vampires are God's tool to purify the earth. 

Mister 

To that end, they use vampires as kind of a chemical weapon, dropping them out of helicopters into neighboring towns.


_Stake Land_ may not be a revelation, but it is a solid entry in the post-apocalyptic horror genre. The production values and performances belie the film's all but straight-to-video release. Sure, the voiceover narration is unnecessary, but it's easy enough to ignore. And come on, _the bad guys drop vampires out of helicopters_. They had my ten bucks right there.

The western genre isn't dead, it's just been renamed. As a post-apocalyptic horror, Stake Land is a prime example.

Stay with me.

The story is set in near-future where vamps (a kind of fast-running-zombie/vampire hybrid) have overrun the world. Enigmatic loner Mister takes in orphaned teen Martin. The pair head out in Mister's old Cadillac in search of the fabled land of New Eden. They run up against a fundamentalist neo-nazi militia that uses vamps as weapons.

Now back to the part about how this is a western.

Instead of bandits or hostile natives, we have vamps. Like the better westerns, Stake Land keeps these baddies off-screen as much as possible, content to let the scenery establish atmosphere.

On their journey, Martin and Mister encounter the remnants of civilization in the form of barricaded townships. Like frontier towns, bartering is the primary economy. Mister trades the fangs he takes from his vamp kills.

_Stake Land_ doesn't add anything new to the post-apocalyptic horror genre, and that's okay. It's dark, but not without some nice touches of black comedy. The production values and performances belie the film's all but straight-to-video release. Sure, the voiceover narration is unnecessary, but it's easy enough to ignore. Now if only they could have somehow gotten Warren Oates to play Mister...

Need to clarify that undead could mean vampires or zombies. Talk about the cult. Need better sense of what the film is like. It gets better isn't clear.
