Staring off in a rural barn, we see a young mother clutching a swaddled baby. It's dark and pouring outside. Her husband has the car's hood up, trying to get it started. An older boy looks at them both with a worried look. A monotone voice on the radio implores people to remain in their homes after dark. There's some voiceover narration by the boy, and then the family dog takes off into the rainy darkness outside. At this point, we can almost count the horror tropes. Indeed, _Stake Land_ doesn't start well.

Fortunately, things get more original. The boy, Martin, meets Mister (Nick Damici, who's good, but Warren Oates would have been perfect), an enigmatic loner who seems to know everything about vampires and how to kill them. The two set out for New Eden, a fabled promised land to the north. Along the way they cross an apocalpytic north east America, much of it controlled by a white supremecist cult.

The film is certainly dark, but not without some nice touches of black comedy. The characters are genre archtypes, the man-with-no-name, the innocent boy, the motherly nun, the tough marine, the religious wacko; we've seen them all before and the film doesn't waste much time fleshing out their characters.

As I said, _Stake Land_ doesn't start well, but the film avoids the genre pitfalls and offers at least one truely inventive scene that makes it worth a look. It's a solid genre film with a few inentive touches.
