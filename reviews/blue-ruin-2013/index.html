There are no explosions, no car chases, and the only gunfight happens off-screen. And yet, it&#39;s a terrifically tense and visceral experience.</p>

<p>The story follows Dwight, a homeless man living on the Delaware coast. When we first meet him, Dwight is taking a bath inside of an empty single-family home. Just as he gets comfortable, Dwight hears the owners arrive and hurries out of the house. It’s an elegant metaphor. As we’ll learn, Dwight has spent much of his adult life running.</p>

<p>One morning, Dwight is roused by the local police, who take Dwight to the station. Dwight isn’t in trouble, but the officers have news and want him to be in a safe place when he hears it.</p>

<p>The man who killed Dwight’s mother and father is getting an early parole.</p>

<p>Dwight takes the news with an eerie calm. He returns to the rusty car he sleeps in, replaces the battery, fills up the tank, and heads home. Home is a small town in the mountains of Virginia.</p>

<p>Dwight travels to the local prison. He arrives in time to see Will Cleland, the man who murdered his parents, walk free. From his car, Dwight watches the Cleland clan arrive in a white limousine to greet Will. In Dwight&#39;s expression we see the mix of bile and nausea churning in his gut.</p>

<p>Dwight follows the limo to a nearby dive bar. He sneaks in through the back door and waits in the mens room. We see the fear in his eyes. Dwight wanted a gun, but all he could afford was the small shiv in his sweaty hand.</p>

<p>Soon, Will enters and Dwight exacts his revenge.  It’s a brutal, clumsy bit of violence that leaves Dwight blood-soaked and shaken. Dwight sneaks out of the bar and pops the limo’s tire with his shiv, gashing his hand in the process. It&#39;s another metaphor. There are no clean getaways. Dwight returns to his car and reaches for his keys…</p>

<p>But they’re not there. Dwight lost them in the fight. It’s a plot point that should feel predictable and forced, but here, like so much of the movie, it feels natural. Almost inescapable. Dwight steals the limo and makes his escape, flat tire and all, but he knows the police will trace his car.</p>

<p>Which brings Dwight to his estranged sister. Their meeting communicates volumes about Dwight’s state of mind. After their parents death, Dwight disappeared, opting to drop out of society rather than face his grief. His sister has grieved and moved on.  She has two small children Dwight has never met.</p>

<p>During the course of their meeting, Dwight realizes that his actions weren&#39;t reported to the police. Meaning the Cleland&#39;s intend to exact revenge on their own. Dwight and his sister rush back to her home to check on her kids. They’re safe, but Dwight knows the Clelands will track the car back to his sister’s house where it’s registered. He convinces her to take her family and leave town. Then Dwight waits for the inevitable.</p>

<p><em>Blue Ruin</em> is a straightforward rural noir. There aren’t any flashbacks or quirky characters. There are no cinematic allusions or pop-culture references. It’s a simple story told well.</p>

<p>Well, almost. Fair warning, I’m about to nitpick what’s otherwise a great film, and in the process, spoil a couple of plot points. If you haven’t seen the movie, I encourage you to give it a look, then come back and read the rest of this review.</p>

<p>Still here? Okay, here goes.</p>

<p>Remember when Ben takes Dwight back to his isolated cabin? Dwight asks Ben if he’s a hunter, and Ben replies no, he mostly does target shooting. For a film that’s so judicious with it’s dialog, one that does such a good job <em>showing</em> us things, this feels sloppy. Because now we know that Ben is going to snipe the guy in Dwight’s car. If a gun is introduced in Act 1 it must go off by Act 3. It&#39;s the only plot point that feels cinematic instead of organic.</p>

<p>Yes, it&#39;s one line. I told you I was going to nitpick. But the next issue is a bit bigger.</p>

<p>Dwight’s parents were killed because Dwight’s father fell in love with Will Cleland&#39;s mother. Watching the movie, this seems plausible enough, but in retrospect it doesn’t hold up. We see the Cleland family. We see the children. They&#39;re foaming-at-the-mouth backwoods psychos. They keep machine guns duct taped under the living room recliner. We also see Dwight and his sister. We see that Dwight has never handled a gun. It begs a question: How does Dwight&#39;s father, a man who raised such a meek family, get together with the kind of woman who would marry the backwoods, gun-crazy Cleland patriarch?  The characters tell us it happened, but the movie shows us nothing to support it.</p>

<p>These bits only stand out because the rest of the film feels so authentic and true. It&#39;s not perfect, but it&#39;s damn close.</p>
