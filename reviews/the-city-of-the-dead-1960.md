One could say that _The City of the Dead_ was ahead of its time. That elements of its structure would be copied by so many other films that they would later be labeled as tropes. But I’ll leave the acadamia to others. I’m here to say the film _works_.

_City of the Dead_ opens in 17th-century New England. In the small, fog-shrouded village of Whitewood, the locals have gathered to burn Elizabeth Selwyn for the crime of witchcraft[^1]. As the flames dance around her, Elizabeth curses the villagers and their decendents, pledging her soul to Lucifer in exchange for eternal life. The bloodthirsty villagers drown her out chanting "Burn witch, burn!"

From there we smash-cut to Christopher Lee as Alan Driscoll, a college professor giving a lecture on witchcraft in the present day. Sitting in rapt attention is our heroine, Nan Barlow, and her boyfriend Bill. The film introduces Bill as something of a chauvenistic oaf, but thankfully, he's only around for a few minutes. 

Nan wants to use the upcoming winter break to write a thesis on witchcraft in New England. Professor Driscoll encourages her to visit Whitewood. Bill, who'd hoped to spent the break with Nan, tries to dissuade her. But Nan won't be swayed, and before long she's pulling up to a desolate filling station in the dead of night asking for directions to Whitewood. The station attendent also tries to dissuade her, but Nan remains resolute. Armed with directions, she heads out into the fog-covered night. 

Outside of town, she picks up a hitchhiker in the form of Jethrow Keane. played by Valentine Dyall. Dyall's perfomance is all ominuous menace. His barritone voice is sinister and otherworldly. 

When Nan finally arrives in Whitewood, she finds a town removed from time. The fog-laden streets look much as they did during the opening sequence. 

You can probably see where this is going. Before I venture any further, let me take a moment to say that the DVD from VCI can be had for under $10 on Amazon and it's the only way to watch the film. It's streaming on Amazon Prime and I've seen a few copies float around on YouTube, but they're cropped, scratchy and low resolution. Spend the $9 and change and watch it on a decent up-converting DVD player. It's worth it.

Back to the review. At this point, those weary of spoilers should stop reading. If you're on the fence, you may want to continue, but be warned that I'm going to spoil a few plot points on the way to illustrating why the film is so good.

Still here? Okay, here we go.

Despite setting up a rather predicatable plot involving Nan travelling to the remote village, discovering evil, getting captured, and rescued by Bill, the film takes a darker turn. Nan is lured into the tunnels beneath the villiage, captured and held down on a sacrificial altar. A black robed figure raises a knife and brings it down as we smash-cut to a knife plunging into a cake at a party at Nan's brother's house. Nan is dead. 

It's quite a narrative surprise, considering she'd been the lone protagonist for the first half of the film. Now it's Nan's brother, Bob, and Bill who retrace her steps and confront the evil lurking in the village. 

And remember Professor Driscoll? It’s hinted early that he might be up to no good, but it could also be a red herring. Well, after Nan meets her fate, there’s no doubt left. Lee delivers a chilling villian. A wolf in sheeps clothing, searching for victims to sustain his cursed breathren.

The film was shot entirely on a sound stage—even the car sequences. Normally this leads to films looking stagey and artificial, but here the filmmakers take advantage of the control offered by a studio shoot and pour on the atmosphere. From the fog-laced outdoor sequences, to the dark, claustrophobic interiors, every scene looks great. The crisp black and white photography is the icing on the cake.

But perhaps more than anything, it’s the editing that makes this movie. From the aforementioned smash-cuts to the brisk pacing,  this film is proof that one can build tension in an efficient manner. 

_The City of the Dead_ is something of an overlooked gem. While Lee’s Hammer work is lauded, this entry by Hammer rival Amicus[^2] is largely forgotten. Not only does it stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Hammer’s best work, it’s modern setting and dark script show a foresight into contemporary horror that Hammer wouldn’t acknowldege until their final film.
