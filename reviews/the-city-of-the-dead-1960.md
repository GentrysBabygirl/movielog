One could say that _The City of the Dead_ was ahead of its time. That elements of its structure would be copied by so many other films that they would later be labeled as tropes. But that's not relevant. What's relevant is that the film works.

_City of the Dead_ opens in 1867? In the small, fog-shrouded New England village of Whitewood, the locals have gathered in the villiage square to burn Elizabeth Selwyn for the crime of witchcraft[^1]. As the flames dance around her, Elizabeth curses the villagers and their decendents, pledging her soul to Lucifer in exchange for eternal life. The bloodthirsty villagers drown her out chanting "Burn witch, burn!"

From there we smash-cut to the present. Christopher Lee is Alan Driscoll, a college professor giving a lecture on witchcraft. Sitting in rapt attention is our heroine, Nan Barlow, and her boyfriend Bill. In a rare misstep, the script introduces Bill as something of a chauvenistic oaf. Fortunately, he's only around for a few minutes. 

Nan wants to use the upcoming winter break to write a thesis on witchcraft in New England. Driscoll encourages her to visit Whitewood. Bill, who'd hoped to spent the break with her, tries to dissuade her. But Nan won't be swayed, and before long she's pulling up to a desolate filling station asking for directions to Whitewood. The station attendent also tries to dissuade her, but Nan remains resolute. Armed with directions, she heads out into the night. 

Outside of town, she picks up a hitchhiker in the form of Jethrow Keane, played by Valentine Dyall. Dyall's perfomance is all ominuous menace. His barritone voice, sinister and otherworldly. 

When Nan finally arrives in Whitewood, she finds a town removed from time. The fog-laden streets look much as they did during the opening sequence. 

You can probably see where this is going. Before I venture any further, let me take a moment to say that the DVD from VCI can be had for under $10 on Amazon and it's the only way to watch the film. It's streaming on Amazon Prime and I've seen a few copies float around on YouTube, but they're cropped and scratchy. Spend the $9 and change. It's worth it.

Back to the review. At this point, those weary of spoilers should stop reading. If you're on the fence, you may want to continue, but be warned that I'm going to spoil a few plot points on the way to illustrating why the film is so good.

Still here? Okay, here we go.

Despite setting up a rather predicatable plot involving Nan travelling to the remote village, getting captured by the witches, and rescued by Bill, the film takes a darker turn. Nan is lured into the tunnels beneath the villiage, captured and held down on a sacrificial altar. A black robed figure raises a knife and brings it down as we smash-cut to a knife plunging into a cake at a party at Nan's brother's house. Nan is dead. 

It's quite a narrative surprise, considering she'd been the lone protagonist for the first half of the film. Now it's Nan's brother, Bob, and Bill who retrace her steps and confront the evil lurking in the village.
