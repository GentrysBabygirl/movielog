One could say that _The City of the Dead_ was ahead of its time. That elements of its structure would be copied by so many other films that they would later be labeled as tropes. 

_City of the Dead_ opens in a small, fog-shrouded New England town. The locals are burning Elizabeth Selwyn for the crime of witchcraft[^1]. As the flames dance around her, she curses the villagers and their decendents, pledging her sould to Satan in exchange for eternal life. The bloodthirsty villagers drown her out chanting "Burn witch, burn!"

From there we smash-cut to Christopher Lee as Alan Driscoll, a college professor giving a lecture on witchcraft. Sitting in rapt attention is our heroine, Nan Barlow, and her boyfriend Bill. In a rare misstep, the script introduces Bill as something of a chauvenistic oaf. Fortunately, he's only around for a few minutes. 

Nan wants to use the upcoming winter break to write a thesis on witchcraft in New England. Driscoll encourages her to visit the small town of Whitewood. Bill, who'd hoped to spent the break with her, tries to dissuade her. But Nan won't be swayed, and before long she's pulling up to a desolate filling station asking for directions to Whitewood. The statioin attendent also tries to dissuade her, but Nan remains resolute. Armed with directions, she heads out into the night. 

Outside of town, she picks up a hitchhiker in the form of Jethrow Keane, played by Valentine Dyall. Dyall's perfomance is a real gem. His icy stare radiates an ominuous menace, as does his barritone voice. 

When Nan finally arrives in Whitewood, she finds a town removed from time. The fog-laden streets look much as they did during the opening sequence. 

You can probably see where this is going. Before I venture any further, let me take a moment to say that there's really only one way to watch this movie. The DVD from VCI can be had for under $10 on Amazon and it's the
