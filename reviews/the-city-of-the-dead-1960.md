_The City of the Dead_ opens in a small, fog-shrouded village. The locals have gathered to burn Elizabeth Selwyn for the crime of witchcraft[^1]. As the flames consume her, Elizabeth curses the villagers. She pledges her soul to Lucifer in exchange for eternal life. The bloodthirsty villagers drown her out, chanting “Burn witch, burn!”

Smash-cut to present day. Christopher Lee is Alan Driscoll, a college professor giving a lecture on witchcraft. Sitting in rapt attention is our heroine, Nan Barlow. Also present is Nan’s boyfriend, Bill, who, we suspect, took the course just to hit on Nan.
Nan wants to use her upcoming winter break to write a thesis on witchcraft in New England. Professor Driscoll encourages her to visit his hometown of Whitewood. Bill, who’d hoped Nan would spend the break with him, tries to dissuade her, but Nan remains resolute.

Before long, Nan’s pulling up to a desolate filling station in the dead of night asking for directions to Whitewood. The station attendant tries to warn her away from the town, but Nan dismisses his concern. Armed with directions, she heads out into the fog-covered night.

Outside of town, she picks up a hitchhiker, played by Valentine Dyall. Dyall’s performance is all ominous menace. When he speaks, it’s less like someone talking and more like something talking _through_ him.

When Nan finally arrives in Whitewood, we recognize it from the opening sequence. The town drips atmosphere, from the fog-laced streets to the dark, claustrophobic interiors. 

Nan checks into the local inn, whose proprietor bears an uncanny resemblance to Elizabeth Selwyn. 

Can you see where this is going?

Before I venture any further, let me say that the DVD from VCI is under $10 on Amazon. It’s the only way to watch the film. There's a print streaming on Amazon Prime and I’ve seen a few others floating around on YouTube, but they’re all cropped, scratchy or low resolution. Spend the $9 and change and watch it on a decent up-converting DVD player. It’s worth it.

Back to the review. At this point, those weary of spoilers should stop reading as I must cover a few plot points to illustrate why the film is so good.

You see, despite setting up a predictable plot where Nan gets captured by Elizabeth and rescued by her boyfriend, the film takes a darker turn. The witches of Whitewood lure Nan into the tunnels beneath the inn. They snatch her and drag her screaming into a hidden chamber. They place her on a sacrificial altar, holding her down as she kicks and thrashes. A black robed figure raises a knife over her chest. Nan screams. The knife drives toward her chest as we smash-cut to a knife plunging into a cake.

Nan is dead.

It’s quite a narrative surprise, considering she’d been the lone protagonist for the first half of the film. Now it’s Nan’s brother, Bob, and Bill who retrace her steps and confront the evil lurking in the village.

And remember Professor Driscoll? It’s hinted early that he might be up to no good, but after Nan meets her fate, there’s no doubt left. Lee delivers a chilling villain. A wolf in sheep’s clothing, searching for victims to sustain his cursed brethren.

Indeed, Lee's performance, like the film, is an overlooked gem. While critics laud Lee's early work for Hammer productions, this entry by Hammer rival Amicus[^2] remains forgotten. It's a shame. Not only does it stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Hammer’s best work, but it’s contemporary setting and darker script foreshadow the cinematic horror trends that proved to be Hammer's undoing[^3].

To that end, one could say _The City of the Dead_ was ahead of its time. That elements of it would be copied by so many other films they would later be labeled as tropes. But I’ll leave the academia to others. Suffice it to say the film _works_.
