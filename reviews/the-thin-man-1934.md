Eccentric inventor Clyde Wynant is preparing to go into seclusion to work on a new project when he’s interrupted by a visit from his daughter Dorothy (O'Sullivan) who announces her engagement. Wynant hurries her out, but promises to return in time for her wedding. Wynant continues his preparations and discovers that the $50,000 in bonds he’d earmarked as a wedding present for Dorothy are missing. He storms over to the apartment of his mistress Julia, catching her in the arms of another man in the process. Wynant accuses her of the theft and threatens to turn her over to the police. Three months later Dorothy hasn’t heard from her father. While out at a restaurant, she recognizes former detective Nick Charles (Powell) and approaches him for help. Nick–happy in his new life of leisure with his heiress wife Nora (Loy)–is reluctant to get involved, but when circumstances pin a pair of murders on the still missing Wynant, Nick steps in and uncovers a buried skeleton along with a labyrinthine array of suspects and motives. The mystery culminates with New York’s finest corralling all the suspects to a dinner party thrown by Nick and Nora, where Nick ferrets out the true killer.

The talky opening betrays the film’s B-movie production, with the script throwing enough plot and characters at us to fill an entire movie, but once Powell makes his appearance–in a posh restaurant bar, demonstrating to an impromptu-crowd how various cocktails demand unique shaking rhythms (Manhattans to a Fox-Trot, Bronxs to a Two-Step, and Dry Martinis to a Waltz)–the dialog goes from stilted to fluid, with Powell gliding through the film as the witty urbane charmer we all believe ourselves to be after a few drinks. There’s little real danger and the entire plot is little more than a MacGuffin to support Powell’s lyrical banter, which reaches it’s apex during the iconic dinner party scene. As Loy says, “It’s the best dinner I’ve ever listened to.”
