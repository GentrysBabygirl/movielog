Sometimes a movie can't live up to its own opening scene. _Circus of Fear_ (_Psycho Circus_, here in the US) opens with a precision armored car robbery. Executed in broad daylight on London's Tower bridge. There's no dialog, but the editing gives the sequence a relentless rhythm. Everything goes off according to plan, until one of the crooks panics and shoots one of the guards.

At this point, with a title like _Circus of Fear_ and no Christopher Lee in sight, one can imagine theater-goers in 1966 wondering if they were in the wrong theater.

The criminals escape and word comes from the unseen mastermind that the hood that panicked should be the one to deliver the loot. The crook makes his way to the meet-up spot, a deserted circus tent, where he's killed by an unseen assailant.

Then the movie shifts.

The police track some of the stolen money to a circus. Christopher Lee finally shows up, though he spends most of the film wearing a black hood. The cops try to find the money but people keep dying thanks to that pesky off-screen assailant. There are lots of red herrings and at least one plot twist you'll likely see coming before everything is wrapped up.

All well and good, but a let down after the great opening.
