_Circus of Fear_ (_Psycho Circus_ in the US) opens with a precision hold up of an armored car. There's no dialog, but the editing gives the sequence a relenteless rhythm. Everything goes off according to plan, until one of the crooks panics and shoots one of the guards. They escape and word comes from the unseen mastermind that the hood that paniced should be the one to deliver the loot. The crook makes his way to the meetup spot, a deserted circus tent, where he's killed by an unseen assailent. 

Then the movie shifts. 
Whodunit in the circus.
Lee spends most of the movie in a black hood.
Lots of red herrings. One plot twist you'll likely see coming.
Competent, but a let down after the great opening.
