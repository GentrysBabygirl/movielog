_To the Devil a Daugher_ was the final film of Hammer Film Productions[^1]. The studio did not go out on a high note.

The story—ah, well, you’re just going to have to bear with me for a moment. See, I’ve seen the movie twice and I’m still not sure about the story. This isn’t a case of deep symbolism or deliberate obfuscation. No, according the featurette on Anchor Bay’s DVD, the filmmaker’s were tweaking the script as they went along, and ran out of money before they reached the end.

Anyway, as near as I can tell, Christopher Lee plays Father Michael, a priest who commits the heresy of putting his faith in man over God. To that end—and here’s where things get fuzzy—he retreats to a compound in Bavaria where he forms his own Satanic religion. One of his alcolytes dies during childbirth and the baby, a girl, is baptized in her dead mother’s blood. The girl, Catherine, grows up as a nun in Father Michael’s compound. On her eigthteenth birthday she travels to London. There, Father Michael will baptize her in the blood of a demon creature birthed by another of Father Michael’s acolytes. 

But, fortunately for humanity, Catherine’s father, Henry, has a change of heart. Henry appeals to American occult novelist John Verney, played by Richard Widmark, who intercepts Catherine at Heathrow airport. John hopes to get a book out of Henry’s story, but soon realizes the stakes are much larger.

Father Michael attempts to reclaim Catherine. John attempts to keep her safe. During the tug-of-war we’re presented with a couple of disturbing scenes.

The first concerns the birth of the demon creature. Picture a staged, antiseptic facsimile of young girl's bedroom. A woman prepares to give birth. Strips of white cloth bind her wrists to the headboard and clamp her knees and ankles shut, giving the baby no escape. Arms spread, knees clenched, she lays crucified to the bed. Her face glistens with sweat as her back arches and her body spasms from another contraction. Her belly swells. Beside her, Father Micheal stands waiting, smiling with eager eyes. 

And later, we see one of Catherine’s visions/dreams. We’re looking through her eyes. She’s pregnant and laying laying on her back. We see her bulging womb. Her legs are open, knees up, in the traditional birthing position. Still through her eyes, we see something crawling up from between her legs. At first glimpse it appears to be a baby, but no, it's a horrid combination of baby and beast with a monstrous jaw and reptilian eyes. Covered in blood, it writhes between her legs, smearing her thighs and stomach with gore. She reaches down and strokes the creature's grotesque head. Now her midsection is awash in a thick, almost syrupy, blood as she gently pushes the thing back down, between her legs. Still through her eyes, we hear her moan in a combination of agony and ecstasy as she forces the monstrosity _back up into her womb_.

Now, in execution, the quality of the creature effects is laughable, but the scene still leaves an impression. 

Unfortunately, the scene has little to do with the story. Instead, it feels like something tacked on as a reaction to _Rosemary’s Baby (1968)_ and _The Exorcist (1973)_. And it’s when you compare this film to those, having come out three and eight years prior respectively, that one begins to understand why Hammer failed. 

This was a studio that, nineteen years prior, had revived the horror genre by injecting a liberal dose of gore and sex into the Universal Monster icons. The resulting films, _Curse of Frankenstein (1957)_ and _Horror of Dracula (1958)_ were edgy and fresh. But time passed and before long Hammer was as stodgy as Universal had been. Hammer shouldn’t have been aping _Rosemary’s Baby (1968)_ and _The Exorcist (1973)_, it should have made them. 

By the time it woke up and tried to tap into the mainstream horror pulse it was too little too late. Christopher Lee does his best, while Richard Widmark, looks tired and bored cashing a paycheck. The bigest indignety is the ending. After an hour and a half of buildup, the ending consists of Widmark throwing a rock at Lee after the equivalent of a mumbo-jumbo rock-paper-scissors. It’s dialog that reads straight from an elementary school playground. I’d laugh but it just seems sad.

[^1]: Until the studio was resurrected in 2008.
[^2]: I’m willing to give the film the benefit of the doubt and assume Father Michael wasn’t doing this for Satan, but for his own gain. That he’s somehow brought about the birth of a demon and by baptizing Catherine in its blood, he could control its power. I know that’s reaching, but I’ve got a soft spot for Hammer.
