In _The Road to Singapore_ William Powell plays Hugh Dawltry, a wealthy British ex-pat returning to his plantation on a small, tropical Pacific island. It seems Hugh has a bit of a reputation as a womanizer, and the small ex-pat community has happily ostracized him during his absence. 

We first meet Hugh aboard ship the day before the ocean liner is due to dock. He spent the trip trying to romance a young lady, Phillipa March, played by Doris Kenyon. Phillipa has resisted his advances, though there’s certainly a chemistry between them.

They dock and Hugh discovers that Phillipa is the wife of local doctor George March, played by Louis Calhern. Phillipa dreams of romance, but George is focused on his work. Phillipa tries to arouse George’s passion, but he can’t even see her desperation. 

Meanwhile, Hugh continues to flirt with the dissatisfied Phillipa, while warding of the advances of her vivacious younger sister-in-law. Things come to a head when, beliving her husband and sister-in-law to be out of town, Phillipa accepts an invitation to dine at Hugh’s bungalow. 

Had _The Road to Singapore_ been made a few years later, it would have crumbled under the weight of the Hayes code. As it stands, it’s a passable melodrama highlighted by a great performance by Powell.

Always impeccably dressed and often a little tipsy (his primary luggage on his return to town seems to have been cases of liquor), Powell ambles through the film exuding the urbane charm that would become his trademark.

There's even a massive tracking shot that, if the budget had supported it, would have elevated this to something special. Granted, as-is, the shot's laughably fake, but kudos to director  Alfred Green for trying.
