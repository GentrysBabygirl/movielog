Whoa there. There be spoilers here. Big spoilers. The kind of spoilers that would ruin _The One I Love_ for folks who haven't seen it. If you're one of those folks and you're on the fence, see it.

Still here? Okay, here we go.

Mark Duplass and Elisabeth Moss play Ethan and Sophie, a young couple on the brink of divorce. Their counselor, played by Ted Danson, sends them to a remote retreat for a weekend getaway. He believes it just what they need to reconnect and rediscover one another.

Ethan and Sophie arrive and discover they're the only people present. They settle in, have a nice dinner and smoke a little grass.

Sophie wanders over to the guest house. Ethan joins her later. They laugh, talk and have a wonderful time. The best they've had in years. They have sex. Later, Sophie heads back to the main house to grab some things. Inside, she's suprised to discover Ethan lying on the couch. 

She laughs and asks how he's beaten her back. Ethan is confused. He's just woken up. Sophie stops laughing. She asks him why he's acting like this after they just has sex. Ethan looks at her with bewilderment. He's been asleep on the couch since they smoked the marijuana, he tells her. Sophie storms off, furious at Ethan's unfunny joke.

Ethan wanders over to the guest house and falls alseep on the couch there. In the middle of the night, Sophie joins him. They snuggle. Ethan wakes to find Sophie making breakfast. Including bacon. Sophie hates the smell of bacon.

By this point, we've got an inkling of what's going on. To the film's credit it doesn't drag things out. Ethan and Sophie soon realize that when one of them enters the guest house alone, they're greeted by a doppleganger of the other. 

They run. Credit to the script, it's what most folks would do. But then they get to thinking about it. Especially Sophie. They talk. Sophie suggests going back. Ethan agrees. They return to the retreat and set some ground rules. Fifteen minute sessions, no intimate activity. Total honesty.

Of course, these rules quickly go out the window. Sophie begins sneaking out to see the other Ethan. Ethan ends up impersonating his doppleganger in order to sleep with Sophie. 

Later, Ethan gets some voicemails from friends and family members suggesting he'd made a series of calls in the middle of the night asking random questions about his past. Some of his clothes seem to have gone missing as well.

Soon the dopplegangers confront Ethan and Sophie as a couple. The four try to have a nice dinner, but Ethan's suspicion and resentment bubble over. He storms off to the guest house. Once inside, he finds he can't get out.

In time, Sophie's doppleganger arrives and reveals the truth. The doppleganger's were just another couple like Ethan and Sophie but now they're trapped here. The only way they can leave is to break up Ethan and Sophie so they can take their place. But something's gone wrong. The other Ethan has fallen in love with the real Sophie. He's planning to leave with her.

Doppleganger Sophie lets Ethan out of the guest house and distracts Doppleganger Ethan (by posing as the real Sophie) so that Ethan can warn Sophie. When Sophie refuses to leave with him, Doppleganger Ethan tries leaving by himself. An invisible wall knocks him cold. Ethan and Sophie leave. 

The next we see, they're lying happily in bed. Sophie gets up and offers to make breakfast, asking if Ethan wants bacon.

David Lynch has built an entire genre of films built around unexplained plots. A _Lynchian_ film usually features some strange, inexplicable event and characters whose motivations are never explicitely verbalized. _The One I Love_ certainly has some _Lynchian_ touches, but it makes the critical flaw of verbalizing it's character's motivations. By defining them, the rest of the story is forced to serve them. When it doesn't you have plot holes.

And boy does this one have a lot of them. The whole film doens't make any sense really. What was the point of imprisoning couples there? Why transform the previous couples into dopplegangers of the next ones? Why can they only leave after the other two have broken up? Why did Ted Danson send them in the first place? All of these questions wouldn't be so problematic if the script hadn't verbalized that the doppleganger's were a previous couple who'd been transformed into Ethan and Sophie, and now planned to break them up in order to be able to leave the retreat. Imagine if the script didn't explain it. If that recording studio and computer were left out, if, when Ethan confronted doppleganger Sophie about not being real, she just sat quietly and stared at him. 

Lynch's films are like lego sets. They provide the audience with the building blocks of a plot, but its up to the viewer to find their own interpretation and meaning. But by _The One I Love_ is less like a set of legos and more like a puzzle. One that's missing a few pieces.

Still, despite it's flaws, _The One I Love_ impressed me. It's a brilliant concept that's handled with the perfect tone.
