_Rasputin: The Mad Monk_ is interesting in its medicrity. If features a terrific performance by Christopher Lee as as the titluar character, and Hammer's usual above-average production values[^1]. 

The story opens with Rasputin arriving at an inn demanding drink. When he's told the inkeeper is unavailable due to his gravely ill wife, an annoyed Rasputin marches upstairs. He storms into the bedroom, and seemingly wills the disease out of the frail woman, drawing it into his now red-hot hands.

Dancing and merriment follows. Rasputin gets good and drunk and takes the innkeeper's daughter out to the barn. This doesn't sit well with her would-be suitor who brawls with Rasputin. Rasputin chops the young lad's hand off saying, "He won't trouble us anymore," then makes to get back with the daughter. But the wounded suitor brings the rest of the villiage, who chase Rasputin out of town.

It's a wonderfully efficient introduction, but it also foreshadows the film's biggest weakness. Rasputin is just a man of hearty appitites. He's not a monster like Dracula, or a man who makes monsters, like Frankenstein, he's just a man. As the film unfolds, Rasputin insinuates himself into the Tsaress's court via one of her ladies in waiting. As his influence grows, members of the court begin to plot against him. There's an overly elaborate plot involving poison, some grappling, then it's all over.

This film isn't epic enough to envolop us in Rasputin's journey, and the script doesn't provide anything in the way of a foil for Rasputin to play against. The resulting film isn't anywhere near as interesting as it could be. Which is a shame because Lee is good in the role. Maybe they were counting on Rasputin's hypnotic powers to work on the audience.
