It’s not hard. Really. It's a simple formula. First, assemble some college-age kids the audience can relate to. Then, put them in an isolated location. Give them something to do that would interest the audience. Usually,  this involves getting laid.  Endear one of the female teens to the audience by having her make good choices. Next, set Jason loose to pick off the teens in various creative ways until only the one who made good choices remains. Finally, dispose of Jason in a suitably gruesome manner.

A simple formula. 

It's spectacular how badly _Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood_ botches it.

The story opens outside a house set on a lake. The same lake Jason was chained to the bottom of at the end of _Jason Lives: Friday the 13th Part VI (1986)_. We see a young girl standing outside the house door. Inside, we can hear her parents fighting. The mom's yelling that the dad promised he wouldn't drink so much. The dad's telling her to shut up and smacking her around. It aims for drama but plays like charicature.

The girl runs down to the lake, walks the length of a short pier, and gets in a small fishing boat. She motors out to the middle of the lake. The dad, dressed like Stewart Smally, comes running out of the house down to the pier. He yells for her to come back. The mom comes out of the house and joins in the yelling. The dad advances down the pier. The little girl gives the dad the stink-eye of death and the pier starts to shake. Not a rumble, but a full-on cartoonish wobble with the pylons jutting several feet into the air. It's an expensive-looking effect, but laughable.

The pier crumbles down, taking the dad with it. We flash forward[^1] to the little girl, now seventeen. Her name is Tina. She hasn’t been back to Crystal Lake since that day. She's returned now with her mother at the coaxing of her smarmy psychiatrist, Dr. Crews. The good doctor says she must confront the death of her father by revisting the scene.

Tina and her mother arrive at the house. Conveniently, there's a house full of teens next door. The hunky one takes an instant interest in Tina. Perhaps he sees something we don't.

A few needless scenes later, Tina inadvertently wakes up Jason via her telekenisis. Jason sets to work massacring the teens next door[^2]. 

Meanwhile, Tina’s mom uncovers Dr. Crews’ true intentions. There's a lot of over emoting and dues ex machina that lands Tina, the mom, and the doctor all on foot in the darkened woods. Prime fodder for Jason.

Everything culminates in a showdown between Tina, the hunky teen from next door, and Jason. Tina uses her telekentic powers to hurl flower pots at Jason. 

Seriously.

This is an awful movie. Sitting through it was a chore. 

Let's start with the good. Zombie Jason looks great. He's a big hulking monster. This entry also sees Jason make use of power tools[^3]. 

That's it for the good.

The film attempts to replicate the scenario from _Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter (1984)_. A house full of teens (complete with misfit) next to a house with a single mom and her teenage daughter. Had it just done that, things might have worked. But it also insists on recycling the "boy who cried wolf" plot and forced melodrama from _Jason Lives: Friday the 13th Part VI (1986)_. Maybe even that would have worked. But that wasn’t enough. Someone had the unfortunate idea to give Tina telekenesis and center the film on a showdown between her and Jason. How did this sound like a good idea?

Worse still, the film demands we care about Tina despite giving us no reason to do so. She’s a passive protagonist who spends most of the film in histronics. When the other kids take an instant dislike to her, we’re on their side.

And speaking of those kids, they have no chemistry between them. They feel like strangers thrown together rather than friends. None of them register. Their scenes are painfully dull.

This all wouldn’t be so bad if the film didn't take itself so seriously. The black humor in the previous entry is gone. So is the manic campiness that accompanied _Friday the 13th: A New Beginning (1985)_. Instead we're asked to suffer through scenes alternating between idle boredom and overraught melodrama. When Jason offs one of the characters it is a relief. Not because it breaks some non-existant tension, but because we’re one step closer to the film’s end. In _Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood_ it’s the audience, not Jason’s prey, that suffers.

[^1]: Placing the entry even _further_ into the then-future of 2001. Who knew?

[^2]: Like everyone in the film, even Jason at times acts without clear motivation. After Tina ressurects him, Jason marches past Tina and the two houses and goes a couple of miles up the road to off a pair of teens before circling back to continue his rampage. 

[^3]: Though, with supernatural strength, one wonders why he bothers.
