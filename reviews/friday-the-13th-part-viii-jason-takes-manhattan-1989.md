I was about to start high school when this movie came out. I was too young to see it, not that I wanted to. It was the eighth entry in what had become a disregarded franchise. Slasher films were passe.

But I remember this movie's release. This was well before the internet was a household thing, but that didn't stop one bit of news from spreading. In a film called _Jason Takes Manhattan_, Jason didn't actually get to New York until the last fifteen minutes or so. Instead, he spends most of the time on a boat.

On a boat? Really? I remember envisioning Jason hiding out on yacht, waiting to for landfall to begin his rampage. It never occurred to me that most of the _killing_ would happen on the boat as well. 

The movie opens on Crystal Lake. A couple of high school kids are fooling around on a boat. An unfortunate sequence of events sees Jason ressurected from his watery grave via electricity. He makes short work of the two teens, reclaiming his trademark hockey mask in the process[^1].

Flast forward to the following morning. The _SS Lazarus_[^2] is about to set sail for New York City, with the local graduating high school class on board. One of the kids, Rennie, is late to arrive. She was reluctant to come, due to a deep fear of the water after almost drowning as a child. Her English teacher, Colleen Van Deusen convinced her. Van Deusen is chaeroning the trip along with Charles McCulloch, a pompus biology who’s also Rennie’s uncle and legal guardian. McCulloch isn’t happy, but Rennie is determined to go.

As they set off, Jason sneaks on board and begins picking off the teans. While he goes about his work we’re preseted with a series of sub-plots. 

Rennie has visions of a small boy drowning. Haughty prom queen Tamara tries to blackmail McCulloch by seducing him on video. The captain’s son, Sean, fails to live up to his father’s expectation that he do the nautical equivalent of backing the car out of the garage. Another teen, Julius, shows he’s a hell of a boxer[^3].

After a while, Jason kills the captain. Sean discovers the body and alerts the rest of the passnegers. The kids arm themselves and attempt to hunt Jason down. But a series of events causes the ship to sink. Sean, Rennie, Julius, McCulloch and Van Deusen manage to get into a life boat and row to the shores of New York City.

But Jason’s right behind them, determined to finish what he started aboard the boat. The finale sees Rennie and Sean running from Jason through a sewer tunnel that’s due to be flushed with toxic waste. 

This installment was the lowest grossing entry in the series. But I think points out that the previous entry, _Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood (1988)_, killed the franchise. _That_ film was awful. This movie is bad, but nowhere near that level of terrible.

Granted, the majority of the film does take place on a boat, but if the marketing department hadn't insisted on the Manhattan title, fans probably wouldn't have minded so much. And this entry once again sees the protagonist saddled with a useless melodramatic sub plot. But the supporting cast is far more compelling, and this installment doesn’t take itself as seriously[^4].

Perhaps this most dissappointing aspect of this entry is not that it takes so long to get to New York, but rather that once it does, Jason gets tunnel vision. He doesn’t care about anyone but the people from the boat. He walks through whole swaths of people and leaves them alone. Jason in a major city should be like a one-man apocolypse, killing anyone and anything within reach. He does off some street punks, but that's about it.

[^1]: This is rediculous. One of the kids gets a hockey mask to scare the other, but it happens to be the exact same kind Jason wore. Right down to the chunk missing thanks to the axe-to-the-face Jason suffered at the end of _Friday the 13th Part III (1982)_.

[^2]: Okay, that’s a good name.

[^3]: Because why wouldn’t a school-sponsored trip to New York City include a little boxing on the way?

[^4]: Two scenes made me chuckle. The first was the culmination of the fight between Jason and Julius. The second was when Jason flips up his mask to the street gang after knocking over thier boom-box. Good bits.
