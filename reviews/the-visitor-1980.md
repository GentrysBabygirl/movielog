Roger Ebert said that a reviewer's job was threefold. First, inform the audience as to what the movie was about. Second, provide a sense of what the movie was like to watch.  As Ebert said, “If it is a Pauly Shore comedy, there are people who like them, and they should be able to discover in your review if the new one is down to their usual standard.” Lastly, the reviewer should state whether or not they liked the film. 

In the case of _The Visitor_, I am at a loss on all three points. 

The film opens with a piercing blue-eyed Christ-like figure telling a group of bald children about the evil space mutant Sateen. The story is cut short when John Huston enters and says that Sateen’s latest incarnation has been confirmed as an eight-year-old girl in Atlanta, Georgia. 

Cut to Atlanta, where we meet the aforementioned girl, Katy, and her mother Barbara, and her mother’s boyfriend Ray, played by Lance Henriksen. 

Katy is, indeed, pure evil. She offs a few unfortunate souls who end up on her bad side, including a detective played by Glen Ford.

In time we learn that Ray is part of a shadowy cabal that want see Barbara impregnated to bear a son. 

John Huston turns out to be the titular Visitor. He’s an alien tasked with taking Katy back to his world to teach her not to be evil. Most of the time though, he hangs out on the roof of a skyscraper with a cadre of bald-headed interpretive dancers. He gives his name as Jerzy Colsowicz and poses as a baby sitter for Barbara and Ray in an effort to confront Katy. It’s an odd confrontation. The two play Pong on a giant projection screen. 

Shelly Winters also shows up as a nanny for Katy. Her scenes are notable for the instance where she slaps young Katy. According to legend, she really did slap the young actress. I like to think that it’s true.

Sam Peckinpah even turns up as Barbara’s ex-husband. She visits him for an abortion after the Sateen cabal takes matters into their own hands following Ray’s failure to impregnate Barbara.

If all this seems just a little disjointed and bizarre, then I have not done my job. It’s _very_ disjointed and bizarre. It is, at times, gruesom. Other times, it’s laughably stilted. Yet, it is also visually striking. Watching the film, one can sense hints of greatness, but the film can’t seem to string these moments together. It is equal parts fascinting and frustrating.

If nothing else, _The Visitor_ me with a strong desire to read a biography of John Huston. If only to understand how he ended up in a film so bizarre.
