As I see it, my job as a reviewer is threefold. I endeavor to describe what a given movie is about, convey a sense of the viewing experience[^1], and give an idea of how I felt about it. 

With _The Visitor_, I am at a loss.  

The film opens with a blue-eyed Christ-like figure telling a group of bald children about the evil space-mutant Sateen. Sateen was a horrible criminal who fled to Earth where he developed psychic powers, which he used to wreak havoc.  An alien defeated Sateen using an army of birds, but not before Sateen had impregnated a slew of Earth women who would continue his legacy through their children. John Huston then enters the room, saying that he’s confirmed Sateen’s latest incarnation as an eight-year-old girl in Atlanta, Georgia. He’ll be leaving at once.

Cut to Atlanta, where we meet the aforementioned girl, Katy, her mother Barbara, and her mother’s boyfriend Ray. Lance Henriksen plays Ray, continuing the film’s surprising casting.

Katy is, indeed, pure evil. She’s got a demonic falcon who helps her off a few unfortunate souls who end up on her bad side, including a detective played by Glen Ford. 

In time we learn that Ray is part of a shadowy cabal of Sateen worshippers that want Barbara impregnated to bear a son. This son would also possess the powers of Sateen and the cabal could harness them for its own ends. It’s not clear why they can’t use Katy, but this is a minor quibble compared to the rest of the plot holes.

John Huston turns out to be the titular Visitor. He’s God, who’s also an alien, and presumably the one who sent the birds to destroy Sateen originally. He’s not here to kill Katy, but to take her back to his world where he’ll teach her not to be evil. Most of the time though, he hangs out on a skyscraper roof with a cadre of bald interpretive dancers. He gives his name as Jerzy Colsowicz and poses as a baby sitter for Barbara and Ray in an effort to confront Katy. It’s an odd confrontation. The two play Pong on a giant projection screen and dance around the fact that neither of them is human.

Shelly Winters shows up as a nanny hired by Barbara. Her scenes are notable for the instance where she slaps young Katy. According to legend, she really did slap the young girl. I like to think that it’s true.

Completing some kind of bizarre casting bingo card, Sam Peckinpah turns up as Barbara’s ex-husband. She visits him for an abortion after the Sateen cabal takes matters into their own hands following Ray’s failure to impregnate Barbara. Unlike John Huston, who appears lucid and sober in his scenes, Peckinpah was allegedly a nightmare to work with and his scenes ended up dubbed. I like to think this is true too.

If all this seems just a little disjointed and bizarre, let me be clear: it is _very_ disjointed and bizarre. 

It is also, at times, gruesome. In a scene that would make Lucio Fulci proud, birds peck at Glenn Ford’s eyes, forcing him to crash his car. Other times, it’s laughably stilted. Like when Katy makes a basketball explode on Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. 

Yet, it is also, at times, visually striking. The opening sequence will get your hopes up. A cloaked John Huston and Katy stare each other down across a desert under an alien sky filled with a giant yellow sun as a sandstorm engulfs them. Watching the film, one can sense hints of greatness, but the film can’t seem to string these moments together. It is equal parts fascinating and frustrating.

If nothing else, _The Visitor_ me with a strong desire to read a biography of John Huston. If only to understand how he ended up starring in a film so bizarre.
