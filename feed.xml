Friday the 13th Part V: A New Beginning (1985) ★★☆☆☆</title><link href='http://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/friday-the-13th-part-v-a-new-beginning-1985/' /><id>http://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/friday-the-13th-part-v-a-new-beginning-1985</id><updated>2014-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</updated><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What were they thinking?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That about sums up my reaction to &lt;em&gt;Friday the 13th Part V: A New Beginning&lt;/em&gt;. After nailing the formula in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/friday-the-13th-the-final-chapter-1984/&quot;&gt;Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter (1984)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; , they throw everything out the window and nearly kill the franchise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This entry follows Tommy, the young boy who survived the previous film by hacking Jason’s body to pieces with a machete. In a startling bit of plausibility, he’s spent the previous six years in a mental institution. He’s eighteen now, putting this film in the then-future of 1990&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a protagonist, Tommy leaves much to be desired. He says all of two-dozen words throughout the film. Instead, he spends most of his time looking either frustrated or confused. He&amp;#39;s also prone to violent outbursts&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn2&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film opens with Tommy arriving at a kind of halfway house for annoying teens&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn3&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. After one of the kids offs another with an axe, an unseen assailant begins murdering teens, staff, and pretty much everyone on screen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harkening back to the original film, this entry is less a monster movie and more of a mystery thriller. But execution is sloppy. The script introduces characters only to kill them in the same scene. Several of the performances veer well into camp, such as the backwoods mother and son living next door to the halfway house. Worst of all, the eventual reveal is unsatisfying. It relies on some awkward exposition to explain the killer’s motive and even then makes little sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fans hated it. The original plan was to setup a new killer for a new series of movies&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn4&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. But after this entry’s disappointing box office returns, the plan changed. Consider the title of the sequel: &lt;em&gt;Jason Lives: Friday the 13th Part VI (1986)&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time has been kind to &lt;em&gt;Friday the 13th Part V: A New Beginning&lt;/em&gt;, however. Knowing that the franchise rights itself, fans can appreciate this entry in a so-bad-it’s-good kind of way. The nonsense plot, Tommy’s non-dialog, and the over-the-top performances are all good for a laugh. One of the characters even dies in an outhouse after eating some spicy enchiladas. What were they thinking, indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to look this up. The series timeline gets really crazy from here on out as they keep skipping forward in time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref1&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These outbursts only serve as a red herring. The one time his vicious fighting skills could actually be of use, they fail him.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref2&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not made clear, but one presumes the state has transferred Tommy due to his having aged out of the system. But what happened to his sister?&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref3&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, the plan was for Tommy to assume the role of Jason. Again, what were they thinking?&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref4&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</content></entry><entry><title>16. Horror of Dracula (1958) ★★★★★</title><link href='http://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/horror-of-dracula-1958/' /><id>http://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/horror-of-dracula-1958</id><updated>2014-12-29T00:00:00-05:00</updated><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Howard Hawks once said that a good movie consisted of  &amp;quot;three great scenes and no bad ones.&amp;quot; Hammer&amp;#39;s first entry in its &lt;em&gt;Dracula&lt;/em&gt; franchise gives us exactly that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first great scene comes early. Jonathan Harker has arrived at Castle Dracula posing as a librarian.  While prowling the castle&amp;#39;s corridors at night, he finds a young woman. She sports ruby red lips, brilliant blue eyes and ample cleavage. She is terrified. She claims she’s being held prisoner. She begs Harker to help her escape. Harker feigns ignorance. She persists. His resolve weakens. He agrees to help her. Grateful, she bursts into tears and buries her head in his shoulder. The music shifts. We see her blue eyes fix on Harker’s neck. Her head tilts back as her eyes close. Her ruby red lips draw back to reveal fangs. She bites Harker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as she does, Dracula (Christopher Lee) bursts into the room with a piercing shriek. Lee is feral and demonic. Shown in close up, His eyes are bloodshot red. His gore-smeared sneer reveals blood-covered fangs. The shot lasts all of a few seconds, but it still packs a punch. This is Dracula in all his visceral glory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second great scene happens at about the three-quarters mark. Dracula has turned Harker&amp;#39;s fiancee Lucy who&amp;#39;s now preying on children. Lucy&amp;#39;s brother Arthur has gone to her crypt at night, to assure himself that she’s not a vampire. To Arthur’s horror, he finds Lucy returning to her tomb, leading a young girl. Lucy&amp;#39;s eyes light up with more than just brotherly love. “Come, let me kiss you,” she says to Arthur. She advances, baring her fangs, but Arthur stands transfixed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before she can consummate the act, Van Helsing (Peter Cushing) appears and thrusts a crucifix into her face. She backs away in agony. Van Helsing, jaw set, eyes full of cold detachment, advances. She&amp;#39;s cornered. Van Helsing presses the crucifix to her forehead. The flesh smolders and burns, leaving the imprint of the cross. Van Helsing stares down, unmoved. Lucy shrieks and flees into her tomb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a crackerjack scene that works just as well today as it did half a century ago. The practical effects still look great and Cushing&amp;#39;s performance in the scene is perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third great scene is the finale. Arthur and Van Helsing have chased Dracula back to his castle. Dawn is fast approaching. Van Helsing catches the count before he can disappear down a secret passage. The two grapple. The count looks to have the upper hand until Van Helsing vaults atop a long table, runs the length and launches himself into the air, grabbing the wall&amp;#39;s tapestry curtains as he lands, pulling them down to let in the morning sun. Dracula tries to flee, but Van Helsing pins him in place by fashioning a make-shift crucifix out of candle holders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The swashbuckling acrobatics cement Van Helsing  as the heroic foil to the villainous Count. Cushing&amp;#39;s Van Helsing isn&amp;#39;t just a wise man with a strong will, he&amp;#39;s a man of action. The iconic monster hunter out to rid the world of supernatural evil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I vacillate between this film and &lt;em&gt;Dracula (1931)&lt;/em&gt; for my favorite interpretation of the Count. I prefer Lee’s grittier performance, but I dislike the overt physicality. His Dracula runs, grapples, and digs holes&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. It makes for more action on screen, but it also lends the character a vulnerability that softens his edge. Also, Lee doesn&amp;#39;t have any dialog apart from his introductory scene, which is a shame. A battle of wills scene between Cushing and Lee would have been dynamite&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn2&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Consider how the classic line, &amp;quot;You are very wise for one who has lived but a single lifetime,” would sound in Lee’s ominous baritone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, &lt;em&gt;Dracula&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Horror of Dracula&lt;/em&gt; here in the US) is a great film. Buoyed by two iconic leads in Cushing and Lee, it rolls along at a terrific pace.  By paring down the supporting cast and playing up the sex and gore, it makes the familiar plot feel fresh and new. It turns a gothic horror story into a thrilling adventure. Hawks&amp;#39; definition of a great movie may be a bit simplistic, but &lt;em&gt;Dracula&lt;/em&gt; is proof that simple can work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hole-digging scene always throws me. Why wouldn’t he put her in the crypt? And how does he happen to have a shovel handy?&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref1&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a shame that Lee and Cushing wouldn’t meet again as Dracula and Van Helsing until the disappointing &lt;em&gt;Dracula A.D. 1972 (1972)&lt;/em&gt;. Cushing starred in the immediate sequel &lt;em&gt;The Brides of Dracula (1960)&lt;/em&gt; which lacked Lee. Lee returned in the third installment &lt;em&gt;Dracula: Prince of Darkness (1966)&lt;/em&gt; which lacked Cushing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref2&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</content></entry><entry><title>15. Interstellar (2014) ★★★☆☆</title><link href='http://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/interstellar-2014/' /><id>http://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/interstellar-2014</id><updated>2014-12-25T00:00:00-05:00</updated><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I know where &lt;em&gt;Interstellar&lt;/em&gt; went wrong. I knew the instant it happened. I may have let out a small groan. But I’m getting ahead of myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s three or four generations into the future. The earth is drying up. Giant dust storms ravage the land. Blight has wiped out all the world’s crops except corn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matthew McConaughey plays Cooper, a former test pilot/engineer who, like just about everyone else, has been forced into farming to survive. He hates it, but he does it to support his two young children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A series of gravitational anomalies lead him to the remnants of NASA. NASA has a plan to save humanity. They’ve discovered a wormhole near Saturn. On the other side are potentially hospitable worlds. They’ve got a ship and crew ready. They just need a pilot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cooper agrees, even though the length of the journey means he’ll miss years of his children’s lives. If he makes it back at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flight goes smoothly and the crew passes through the wormhole in a sequence that begs favorable comparisons with &lt;em&gt;2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)&lt;/em&gt;. On the other side they assess their situation. There are three potential worlds, but the closest and most promising orbits the outskirts of a black hole. This creates a warping effect with time. An hour spent on the surface of the planet equates to seven years back on earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They agree to be quick. Cooper pilots a shuttle craft with two other scientists down to the planet&amp;#39;s surface. The plan is to be in-and-out, but of course, there are complications. They return to the main craft just over three hours later, only to find that twenty three years have passed on earth. Cooper checks the equivalent of his mail in the form of video messages. He sees his son graduate high school, meet a girl, and get married. He sees the birth and death of his grandson. Finally, he sees his son, now a man older than himself, say goodbye, resigned that Cooper is never coming back. Cooper has missed it all. It flattens him and us. Never has a movie conveyed the isolation of space travel like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, Cooper gets a message from his daughter. They had a rough falling out as he left. She felt he was abandoning her. Now, she’s a full grown woman, the same age as him. But she’s still bitter at him for leaving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this brings us to the point I mentioned earlier. The point where Interstellar loses its way. The film cuts to Cooper’s daughter as she finishes her message. Now we’re back on earth. No longer alone. Now, we have parallel stories, Cooper in space and Cooper’s family on earth. What started as a meditation on mankind transcending earth devolves into a predictable melodrama. The effects are fantastic, and there are some nail-biting set pieces, but the film has nothing new to say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s tempting to think that &lt;em&gt;Interstellar&lt;/em&gt;’s reach exceeded its grasp. That it tried and failed. I don’t think it tried at all. Rather than explore new themes it settled for the comfort of familiar dramatic scenarios. Granted, it executes those tropes with masterful precision. But &lt;em&gt;Interstellar&lt;/em&gt; had the chance to transcend the science fiction genre. Instead, it abandoned it.&lt;/p&gt;
</content></entry><entry><title>14. Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter (1984) ★★★☆☆</title><link href='http://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/friday-the-13th-the-final-chapter-1984/' /><id>http://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/friday-the-13th-the-final-chapter-1984</id><updated>2014-12-14T00:00:00-05:00</updated><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Now, I know what some of you are thinking: &lt;em&gt;How can he give a piece of trash like this three stars?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hear me out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When this movie came out, I was still waking up Saturday mornings to watch cartoons. All I knew of &lt;em&gt;Friday the 13th&lt;/em&gt; came from looking at the box covers in the video store. I was sure those white body outlines holding bloody knives and axes were gateways to pure, brutal terror. So, of course, I wanted to watch them. But I never did. Neither did any of my friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it’s an odd sense of nostalgia that draws me to the films now. Of course, they’re not as scary as my young self believed. But watching them takes part of me back to the days of looking for prizes in breakfast cereals. Back when a monster as simple as Jason represented the pinnacle of terror.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This entry is likely the best of the series. It picks up right where &lt;em&gt;Friday the 13th Part III (1982)&lt;/em&gt; leaves off&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Hanged after suffering a hatchet to the face, Jason is dead. The police cart him off to the morgue where he&amp;#39;s bagged and tagged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But of course, he’s not dead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jason wakes up and dispatches some of the improbably young hospital staff. Then he heads back to Crystal Lake where he works his way through a house full of oversexed teens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This film operates based on a simple formula: Titillate the audience via some nudity, then have Jason dispatch someone in a gruesomely over-the-top fashion&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn2&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.  To that end, it delivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what elevates this entry above the rest of the series is how it handles the cast of teen victims. For most of the film, they are unaware of Jason, or any suspicious goings on. They&amp;#39;re in their own movie, complete with their own sub-plots. Granted, those sub-plots amount to little more than a bad teen sex comedy, but they hold our interest when Jason&amp;#39;s off-screen&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn3&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Jason doesn&amp;#39;t so much stalk these teens as pick them off at will. He&amp;#39;s no longer just a deranged man with a knife. He&amp;#39;s a true monster&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn4&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. A demon with a machete. He marches  through the film as an unstoppable, inhuman force of evil. He doesn&amp;#39;t run. Running implies chasing which suggest the possibility of escape. In this film, Jason is not an assailant, he is an inevitability&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref5&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn5&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result is an amalgam of gratuitous nudity and creative violence. It&amp;#39;s pure exploitation, sure, but it never pretends to be anything more. I can respect that. And I can enjoy the visceral thrills that a good exploitation picture delivers.  &lt;em&gt;Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter&lt;/em&gt; isn&amp;#39;t a great movie, but it&amp;#39;s everything my younger self could have hoped for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Films two, three and four happen back-to-back, taking place over the course of four days. This entry starts the night of Sunday the 15th, and ends on Tuesday the 17th. This proves to be something of a problem, however. See, one of the characters is out to avenge his dead sister, who Jason killed in the second film. This character has all kinds of newspaper clippings about Jason that he’s been compiling since his sister died. Except, by the film’s timeline, his sister died less than 48 hours ago.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref1&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Friday the 13th&lt;/em&gt; films are far from the only horror movies to do this. One of &lt;em&gt;Alien (1979)&lt;/em&gt;’s best scares comes after the camera lingers on a wall full of posters of nude women.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref2&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also helps that Crispin Glover&amp;#39;s performance foreshadows his turn in &lt;em&gt;Back to the Future (1985)&lt;/em&gt;. His dancing scene alone almost makes the film worth a look.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref3&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jason Lives: Friday the 13th Part VI (1986)&lt;/em&gt; cements this personification by turning him into a kind of Frankenstein&amp;#39;s monster.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref4&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I consider this an explanation of how Jason seems to teleport around the house. He goes from outside the second floor window to inside the first floor kitchen in a matter of seconds without making a sound.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref5&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;h3&gt;a great movie&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;5 stars&quot; src=&quot;images/5-stars-4661cb2a.svg&quot; /&gt; I loved it. A must-see. A perfect or nearly perfect movie. These are the movies I recommend to everyone. This is a hard rating to earn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;h3&gt;a good movie&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;4 stars&quot; src=&quot;images/4-stars-92a55331.svg&quot; /&gt; I really liked it. Unless you hate the genre or the star, you should watch it. These are the movies I recommend to most folks. They may not resonate like the 5-star selections, but they don&amp;#39;t disappoint either. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;h3&gt;an okay movie&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;3 stars&quot; src=&quot;images/3-stars-ebc473a3.svg&quot; /&gt; I liked it. I wouldn&amp;#39;t recommend it, but I wouldn&amp;#39;t necessarily recommend &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; it either. A good rule of thumb: If I liked it but can&amp;#39;t remember a line of dialog one-week later, it was just okay. Many a summer blockbuster falls into this category. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;h3&gt;a bad movie&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;2 stars&quot; src=&quot;images/2-stars-9f281273.svg&quot; /&gt; I didn&amp;#39;t like it. Unless you have a deep-seeded love for the genre or star, avoid this. Maybe it had a moment or two of goodness, but it was a disappointment. If I paid money to see it, I felt burned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;h3&gt;an awful movie&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;1 star&quot; src=&quot;images/1-star-a314fc32.svg&quot; /&gt; I hated it. Not even in the “so-bad-it&amp;#39;s-good” sense. Everyone involved should apologize. This too is a hard rating to earn. When reading a 1-star review, remember: I watch them so you don&amp;#39;t have to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;On Grading&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s start with a binary scale. A yes or no. Gene Siskel based the famous &amp;#39;Thumbs up/Thumbs down&amp;#39; system on the thought that a person just wants to know: “Should I see this movie?” &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a pragmatic approach, but how do you separate the good from the great? Put another way, both &lt;em&gt;Batman Begins&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Dark Knight&lt;/em&gt; would get a &amp;quot;Thumbs up&amp;quot; but they are not equal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter the star scale. I&amp;#39;ve seen scales with three stars all the way up to ten, sometimes with half-stars between. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But not all star-systems are equal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roger Ebert hated the four-star scale his paper used because it offered no middle ground.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn2&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; He&amp;#39;s right, with no middle ground every movie must be either good or bad. Most movies are just okay. Thus, we can rule out the four-star system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, let&amp;#39;s consider the iMDb. It uses a ten-star system. That’s a lot of stars. In 2009 the median movie score was a 6.6. This implies that users are skewing toward the upper bounds. Defining the ratings could mitigate this, but that in itself is a challenge. If a 1-star rating means you hated it, and a 10-star rating means you loved it, what does a 3-star rating mean? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if four is too small and ten is too large, what&amp;#39;s ideal?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like the 5-star system. Ebert liked it too&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. It offers a middle ground (3-stars) while remaining small enough to allow for discreet rating definitions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what about letter grade systems?&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn3&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. I quite like them. They&amp;#39;re essentially a five-star system with an ‘A’ as 5-stars, a ‘B’ as 4-stars and so on. I use a letter grade system behind the scenes because it&amp;#39;s how my brain works. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why display them as stars? Well, for one, grade definitions aren&amp;#39;t universal. To me, a ’C’ grade means an “okay” movie, to others it means a bad movie. A 3-star out of 5 display makes it clear it&amp;#39;s a middle-of-the-road rating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other reason is Netflix. With the service&amp;#39;s rise in popularity, I decided to synchronize my grades with their review system. Thus, if you&amp;#39;ve rated movies on Netflix, my definitions will be familiar. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grading systems are harder than one would think. It&amp;#39;s all about nuance. I think a 5-star system works, but I’m not married to the idea. Some of my favorite reviewers don’t rate at all. They’d rather you just read the review. Fair enough, but I bet they rate titles on Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ebert, Roger, “You Give Out Too Many Stars”, &lt;em&gt;Roger Ebert&lt;/em&gt; , last modified September 14, 2008, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rogerebert.com/rogers-journal/you-give-out-too-many-stars&quot;&gt;http://www.rogerebert.com/rogers-journal/you-give-out-too-many-stars&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref1&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ebert also argues that &lt;em&gt;readers&lt;/em&gt; dislike scales with a middle ground, but I disagree. We all know what it means for a movie to be just “okay.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref2&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 (2014) ★☆☆☆☆</title><link href='http://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/the-hunger-games-mockingjay-part-1-2014/' /><id>http://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/the-hunger-games-mockingjay-part-1-2014</id><updated>2014-12-06T00:00:00-05:00</updated><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Full disclosure: I haven&amp;#39;t seen the first two &lt;em&gt;Hunger Games&lt;/em&gt; films, nor have I read the books. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, the film did an admirable job of bringing me up to speed. Our heroine, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) has just destroyed the titular Hunger Games, dealing a symbolic blow to the evil Capitol. Rebel forces have rescued her, but they were unable to rescue her true love Peeta, who&amp;#39;s now in the Capitol&amp;#39;s clutches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the part where I try and tell you what the movie was about. But I am at a loss. Watching this film felt like watching the deleted scenes from a better movie. A movie where things actually happen. &lt;em&gt;The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1&lt;/em&gt; has little to no plot, and the characters end the film more or less where they started. Katniss frets about Peeta, walks through a lot of rubble-strewn towns, and frets about Peeta some more. You could condense the entire film into fifteen minutes and not lose a thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But &lt;em&gt;The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1&lt;/em&gt; is not fifteen minutes. It&amp;#39;s just over two hours long. Two hours of nothing but filler. It’s inexcusable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I’m not saying a movie needs action. A meditation on Katniss being caught as pawn between the two forces vying for control of a dystopian society could be interesting if the sides weren&amp;#39;t so black and white. The capital is evil and the rebels are good. With no gray area, the film loses any shot at a creditable political commentary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Lawrence is a good actress capable of commanding your attention on screen, but you wouldn&amp;#39;t know it from watching this movie. Between the ill-fitting jump suit and pale makeup, she looks every bit as listless as the script. Her supporting cast includes Philip Seymour Hoffman and Julianne Moore. To their credit, they do a good job of not rolling their eyes at the dialog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1&lt;/em&gt; is a non-movie. It has no reason to exist outside of gouging fans of the series for the cost of an extra ticket. Just skip straight to the real finale in  &lt;em&gt;The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
</content></entry><entry><title>11. The Road to Singapore (1931) ★★★☆☆</title><link href='http://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/the-road-to-singapore-1931/' /><id>http://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/the-road-to-singapore-1931</id><updated>2014-10-22T00:00:00-04:00</updated><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a shot in &lt;em&gt;The Road to Singapore&lt;/em&gt; that sums up the film. It&amp;#39;s night. Cross-fade from natives pounding jungle drums to a woman gazing out her bedroom window. The camera then pans out, away from her window, and up, across acres and acres of dark jungle to settle behind a man standing on his porch, gazing at the woman’s bungalow in the distance.
Now granted, the shot&amp;#39;s tracking over an obvious paper mache model, but kudos to director Alfred Green for trying. This is a movie whose reach simply exceeds its grasp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The woman in the shot is Doris Kenyon. She plays Phillipa. The man is William Powell. He plays Hugh. The setting is Khota, a small tropical island in the Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phillipa is caught in an unhappy marriage to the local doctor. She wants him to sweep her off her feet, he wants her to find his socks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hugh has just returned to the island after supposedly running off with another man’s wife. Hugh and Phillipa flirt. Her resolve weakens. Things come to a head when Phillipa, believing her husband to be out of town, accepts an invitation from Hugh to dine at his bungalow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At it’s heart, &lt;em&gt;The Road to Singapore&lt;/em&gt; is the story of an ill-conceived marriage. One helped along to dissolution by a preponderance of melodrama and jungle drums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It tries for passionate drama, and might have come close for its time. Of course, it feels timid now. It has some bad moments, such as when its characters slip into that era’s favorite affectation of delivering their lines while staring off at nothing in particular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the film is entertaining thanks to Powell’s performance. Despite the subject matter, the film gives him ample opportunities to showcase his comedic timing. He ambles through much of the film exuding the urbane wit and charm that would become his trademark. He wins us over just as he wins over Phillipa. After all, who else could look at home in the jungle, dressed in a tuxedo?&lt;/p&gt;

British Intelligence (1940) ★★☆☆☆</title><link href='http://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/british-intelligence-1940/' /><id>http://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/british-intelligence-1940</id><updated>2014-10-13T00:00:00-04:00</updated><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Fair warning, I’m going to spoil the entire plot of &lt;em&gt;British Intelligence&lt;/em&gt;. I see no other way to review the film. Plot is all it has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s World War I and the British are hurting. The Germans seem to know every move they’re about to make before they make it. The British suspect someone in their organization is the famed German spy Strendler. But no one knows what Strendler looks like. The British resolve to pull their best spy out from undercover field duty to weed out Strendler. But even that plan leaks to the Germans, who kill the British agent and shoot down his extraction plane. The pilot, Frank Bennett, survives and we see him in a hospital being tended to by a nurse, Helene von Lorbeer (Margaret Lindsay). There’s an attraction between the two, but she says she has to leave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Von Lorbeer turns out to be a German spy. She’s recalled to headquarters, given a commendation and a new assignment. Posing as a refugee, she’s to infiltrate the house of British cabinet minister Arthur Bennett. Arthur is, of course, Frank’s father.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Von Lorbeer ingratiates herself with the Bennett family. Her contact is the family butler Valdar (Boris Karloff). Unbeknownst to von Lorbeer, Valdar is a double-agent, reporting to the head of British Intelligence. After some sloppy code-passing, British Intelligence begin to suspect von Lorbeer. They set a trap involving a would-be German agent, but von Lorbeer sees through it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The return of Frank Bennett prompts von Lorbeer to reveal that she’s actually a &lt;em&gt;British&lt;/em&gt; agent. Valdar overhears this and forces von Lorbeer into the cellar at gunpoint. Von Lorbeer explains that she had to make up the British agent story to allay Frank’s suspicions. After showing the commendation award she received from German command, Valdar believes her story and admits that he is, in fact, Strendler. Further, the British cabinet are meeting upstairs and Valdar plans to blow up the house under the guise of a Zeppelin bombing. He’s even stolen the plans for the next British offensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the authorities have Valdar under surveillance and they rush into the cellar in time to disarm the bomb. Valdar flees with the plans. He’s shot during his escape but makes it to a German safe house. Just as they’re about to transmit the plans, a Zeppelin bomb levels the building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s a lot of plot. The labyrinthine twists of agents, double agents, and triple agents, leaves little room for characterization. But maybe that’s by design. Characterization requires some degree of plausibility, and the more one thinks about this film, the more it devolves into a series of flimsy revelations and deus ex machina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider Valdar’s big reveal that he is Strendler. If Valdar was working for the British he would have told them about von Lorbeer, making the ruse involving the fake German agent unnecessary. But if Valdar didn’t tell the British about von Lorbeer, how did they know her handler’s code phrases? Surely, things like that wouldn’t be reused between agents. And just how did Valdar acquire so much information? It would seem that his intelligence gathering consists of little-more than standing outside thin doors or open windows. As a butler he wouldn’t be privy to any intelligence discussed at a secure location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worse still, even at only an hour and six minutes, &lt;em&gt;British Intelligence&lt;/em&gt; is too long. The whole opening sequence only serves to introduce Frank Bennett and he disappears for the rest of the film, only showing up for a few minutes just before the end. Why not start with von Lorbeer undercover? She’d be a sympathetic character we’d actually care about, at least until her reveal as a German spy, which would have been a good one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least Karloff is good in what amounts to a triple role. It&amp;#39;s nice to see him work outside the horror genre, but he can’t save this mess.&lt;/p&gt;

For the Defense (1930) ★★★☆☆</title><link href='http://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/for-the-defense-1930/' /><id>http://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/for-the-defense-1930</id><updated>2014-10-11T00:00:00-04:00</updated><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For the Defense&lt;/em&gt; stars William Powell as Bill Foster. Bill is a slick defense lawyer famous for using any technicality or loophole to get his clients an acquittal, despite their obvious guilt. He’s so well-respected in the underworld that, when his car’s stolen, the crooks return it after getting a look at the registration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bill’s seeing a showgirl, Irene, played by Kay Francis. Irene wants Bill to marry her, but Bill says he&amp;#39;s not the marrying kind. Irene&amp;#39;s also seeing another guy, Jack, behind Bill&amp;#39;s back. Jack’s a nice-enough guy, but he lacks Bill’s swagger. Jack wants to marry Irene, but Irene just strings him along,  hoping Bill will change his mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early one morning, Irene’s driving Jack home. The two have been out all night and Jack’s pie-eyed drunk. Jack gropes at her, causing her to hit and kill a stranded motorist. Recognizing what it would do to her reputation, were she discovered out with him at the early hour, Jack insists she flee the scene. Jack stays and takes the rap for the death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Irene persuades Bill to take Jacks’s case. But as the evidence comes to light, Bill realizes Irene was out with Jack. Things look bad for Jack. Soon, Bill realizes he’ll have to chose between Irene’s reputation and Jack’s liberty. Irene wants to take the stand to exonerate Jack, but Bill won’t let her ruin her reputation. There’s another option, but it means crossing a line Bill had set for himself and risking everything he’s worked for in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As melodramas go, &lt;em&gt;For the Defense&lt;/em&gt; isn’t a bad one. Early on, when Bill’s riding high, his urbane charm, affinity for alcohol, and underworld connections foreshadow Powell’s famous turn as Nick Charles in the &lt;em&gt;Thin Man&lt;/em&gt; series of films. Francis plays well opposite him and doesn’t overact her part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the film sees both of them delivering lines and, mid-sentence, turning to gaze at nothing in particular for dramatic effect. It’s an annoying affectation that mars an otherwise passable hour and five minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and look fast for Gabby Hayes in an uncredited bit-part as a speakeasy waiter.&lt;/p&gt;
</content></entry><entry><title>8. A Walk Among the Tombstones (2014) ★☆☆☆☆</title><link href='http://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/a-walk-among-the-tombstones-2014/' /><id>http://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/a-walk-among-the-tombstones-2014</id><updated>2014-09-25T00:00:00-04:00</updated><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Walk Among the Tombstones&lt;/em&gt; has the potential to be good, but it never comes together. Too much gets in the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plot is a hodgepodge of cop-thriller clichés. The protagonist is Matthew Scudder, played by Liam Neeson. Scudder is a recovering alcoholic and ex-cop. Scudder quit the force after gunning down a gang of street toughs who tried to hold up his neighborhood bar. His superiors called him a hero and gave him a commendation. Scudder quit anyway. He quit drinking too. Later, we learn his actions weren&amp;#39;t quite so heroic. It&amp;#39;s supposed to be a revelation, but anyone who&amp;#39;s seen more than a few cop movies will see it coming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scudder now makes his living as an unlicensed private investigator. He takes the case of a drug trafficker who’s wife was kidnapped, raped, tortured and killed. The trail leads him to a pair of horrific sociopaths who’ve been doing this for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the part of the movie that had potential. We see Scudder work the case even as the killers stalk their next target. It&amp;#39;s dark, gritty and even a little creepy. But like I said, things get in the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like Scudder acquiring a sidekick in the form of TJ, a street-smart homeless boy. TJ has sickle-cell anemia, a plot point that seems to exist as a cheap way to generate audience sympathy as well as enable the improbable third act. Of course, this leads to the tired sub-plot where the plucky street-kid breaks through the gruff ex-cop’s tough exterior. It goes nowhere and feels out of place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the movie wore on, I found myself getting more and more angry. The contempt for the audience&amp;#39;s intelligence is galling. Though meant for adults, the film treats us like children. Scudder verbalizes every clue, even when it makes no sense for him to do so. At one point, Scudder discovers some badly written romance fiction. He reads it aloud, even though he&amp;#39;s alone and the camera is looking at the page. This is a film that doesn’t even trust us to be able to read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This spoon-feeding of the plot results in lots of redundant scenes. The movie opens with one. Scudder sits in the car with his partner. The partner bemoans Scudder&amp;#39;s drinking, saying he worries he can’t count on Scudder to have his back. Scudder gets out of the car and walks into a bar. It’s morning. He grabs a paper and sits down. Without a word the bartender brings Scudder a coffee and two shots of whiskey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why not just open with Scudder walking into the bar? The morning light, the lack of dialog, the coffee and two shots; they tell us everything we need to know. Not to mention we never see that partner again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to like this movie, I really did. I love a good detective story, and the film even name-checks Sam Spade and Phillip Marlowe. But it follows that with a joke based on a dated football reference that wouldn&amp;#39;t be funny even if it were current.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few minutes on Wikipedia tells me that the film is a combination of several novels by Lawrence Block. Maybe the film tried to condense too many plot-points into a single movie, or maybe the books were just bad. Whatever the reason, it&amp;#39;s pretty damning that Liam Neeson’s would-be New York accent is the least of this film&amp;#39;s problems.&lt;/p&gt;
