The Searchers (1956) ★★★★★</title><link href='https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/the-searchers-1956/' /><id>https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/the-searchers-1956</id><updated>2015-06-20T00:00:00-04:00</updated><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Searchers&lt;/em&gt; is a very good film about a very flawed man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set in the fallout of the Civil War, John Wayne plays Ethan Edwards, a former Confederate soldier turned drifter who visits his brother’s family on the Texas frontier. Shortly after he arrives, Comanches massacre Ethan’s brother and sister-in-law. After the funeral, Ethan sets off in search of his young niece Debbie, whom the Comanche have taken captive. Accompanying Ethan is Martin Pawley, an orphan who Ethan’s brother and sister-in-law raised as their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Years pass as the two search. Director John Ford uses the gigantic mesas of Monument Valley to frame his characters as tiny and alone. Small specs on the vast, unforgiving landscape of the frontier. The trail goes cold. The pair catch a break. The trail goes cold again. Ethan’s hatred for the Comanche begins to consume him. In time, Martin realizes with growing horror that Ethan means to kill Debbie should they find her. Such is Ethan’s unbridled hate for the Comanche, that he can’t bear the thought of her having gone native.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film isn’t all dark. During the breaks when the trail goes cold, Ethan and Martin return home. There, Martin and a young pioneer girl fumble at flirtation in a series of slapstick events. These bits can be jarring, but they exist to lighten the mood. Without them, the ending would feel disingenuous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putting aside these comedic interludes, this is Wayne’s movie. He gives a fearless performance. Consider his introduction. Disillusioned after losing the war, he is a man full of rage with no outlet. While he’s all smiles around his family, when he meets Martin he goes cold. Martin is one-eighth Comanche. Wayne’s character identifies him as ‘the other’ and his bitterness bubbles to the surface. In Ethan, Wayne inhabits a disenfranchised, bitter man. After battling on the losing side of a war, he longs for validation. In the Comanche he finds an outlet for his rage. A chance to redeem himself in his own mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But of course, he’s beyond redemption. The now-famous closing shot illustrates this perfectly. As everyone enters the house, Ethan remains standing outside. He shifts his weight and watches the emotional warmth inside before turning and walking back toward the frontier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it’s this refusal to judge or redeem Wayne’s character that makes &lt;em&gt;The Searchers&lt;/em&gt; resonate. While Ethan may have moments of compassion and heroism, the film doesn’t allow for a contrived finale wherein he is somehow cured of his bigotry. Nor does it paint him as a one-dimensional villain. Instead, we’re left to acknowledge Ethan’s nature and contemplate the role men like him played in the settling of the American West. &lt;/p&gt;

The City of the Dead (1960) ★★★★☆</title><link href='https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/the-city-of-the-dead-1960/' /><id>https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/the-city-of-the-dead-1960</id><updated>2015-06-13T00:00:00-04:00</updated><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The City of the Dead&lt;/em&gt; opens in a small, fog-shrouded village. The locals have gathered to burn Elizabeth Selwyn for the crime of witchcraft.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; As the flames consume her, Elizabeth pledges her soul to Lucifer in exchange for eternal life. The bloodthirsty villagers drown her out, chanting “Burn witch, burn!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smash-cut to an extreme close-up of Christopher Lee repeating the same line. It&amp;#39;s present day. Lee plays Alan Driscoll, a college professor lecturing a group of young students on the history of witchcraft. In attendance are our heroine, Nan, and her boyfriend Bill. Nan sits in rapt attention, shushing Bill&amp;#39;s snide comments. It&amp;#39;s clear Bill took the course just to hit on Nan. It&amp;#39;s less clear what she sees in him.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn2&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the lecture, Nan approaches Professor Driscoll. Nan wants to use her upcoming winter break to write a thesis on witchcraft in New England, but feels she needs some fist-hand research. She plans to get a room in the smallest, oldest town in New England she can find. There she’ll comb through the town hall records, recheck the libraries, and interview the puritan descendants. Impressed by her enthusiasm, Driscoll suggests she visit his hometown, a small New England village called Whitewood. Nan agrees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bill, who’d hoped Nan would spend the break with him, tries to dissuade her, but Nan remains resolute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before long, Nan’s pulling up to a desolate filling station in the dead of night asking for directions to Whitewood. The station attendant tries to warn her away, but Nan dismisses his concern. Armed with directions, she heads out into the fog-covered night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside of town, Nan picks up a hitchhiker, played by Valentine Dyall. Dyall’s performance is all ominous menace. When he speaks, it’s as though someone is talking &lt;em&gt;through&lt;/em&gt; him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Nan finally arrives in Whitewood, we recognize it from the opening sequence. The town drips atmosphere, from the fog-laced streets to the dark, claustrophobic interiors. Nan turns to her passenger who, of course, has vanished. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nan checks into the local inn. The proprietor bears an uncanny resemblance to Elizabeth Selwyn. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can you see where this is going?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I venture any further, let me say that the DVD from VCI is under $10 on Amazon. It’s the only way to watch the film. There&amp;#39;s a print streaming on Amazon Prime and I’ve seen a few others floating around on YouTube, but they’re all cropped, scratchy or low resolution. Spend the $9 and change and watch it on a decent up-converting DVD player. It’s worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to the review. At this point, those weary of spoilers should stop reading as I must cover a few plot points to illustrate why the film is so good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, despite setting up a predictable plot where Nan gets captured by Elizabeth and rescued by her boyfriend, the film takes a darker turn. The witches of Whitewood lure Nan into the tunnels beneath the inn. They snatch her and drag her screaming into a hidden chamber. They place her on a sacrificial altar, holding her down as she kicks and thrashes. A black robed figure raises a knife over her chest. Nan screams. The knife drives toward her chest as we smash-cut to a knife plunging into a cake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nan is dead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s quite a narrative surprise, considering she’d been our lone protagonist. Now it’s Nan’s brother, Bob, and Bill who retrace her steps and confront the evil lurking in the village.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And remember Professor Driscoll? It’s hinted early that he might be up to no good, but after Nan meets her fate, there’s no doubt left. Driscoll is a wolf in sheep’s clothing, searching for victims to sustain his cursed brethren. Lee plays him with a perfect mix of cultured charm and seething menace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, Lee&amp;#39;s performance, like the film, is an overlooked gem. While critics laud Lee&amp;#39;s early work for Hammer productions, this entry by Hammer rival Amicus&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn3&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; remains forgotten. It’s a shame, especially considering this film’s combination of contemporary setting and satanic themes foreshadowed the cinematic horror trends that proved to be Hammer’s undoing.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn4&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To that end, one could say &lt;em&gt;The City of the Dead&lt;/em&gt; was ahead of its time. That elements like the filling station attendant attempting to warn the unsuspecting strangers, or the red-herring protagonist, have been copied by so many other films they&amp;#39;re now regarded as tropes. But I’ll leave the academia to others. Suffice it to say the film &lt;em&gt;works&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A likely inspiration for the witch burning skit in &lt;em&gt;Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975)&lt;/em&gt;. &amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref1&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_City_of_the_Dead_(film)&quot;&gt;the article on Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, producer Milton Subotsky added the character of Bill when he rewrote George Baxt’s script.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref2&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then called Vulcan Pictures.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref3&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hammer wouldn’t produce a contemporary satanic-themed horror film until &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/to-the-devil-a-daughter-1976/&quot;&gt;To the Devil a Daughter (1976)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, their final film. Meanwhile, films like &lt;em&gt;Rosemary’s Baby (1968)&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Exorcist (1973)&lt;/em&gt; made millions at the box office.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref4&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</content></entry><entry><title>40. WolfCop (2014) ★★★★☆</title><link href='https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/wolfcop-2014/' /><id>https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/wolfcop-2014</id><updated>2015-04-18T00:00:00-04:00</updated><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;WolfCop&lt;/em&gt; is about an alcoholic sheriff’s deputy who becomes a werewolf and uses his newfound powers to clean up his small town. It’s ridiculous in the best possible way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They don’t make movies like this anymore. Nowadays, B movies are homogenized, euphemistic, schlock neutered for release on basic cable. The manic energy is gone, along with any sense of pride from the people involved. Instead, we get half-assed camp with D-list performers that can’t disguise their contempt for the material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To that end, &lt;em&gt;WolfCop&lt;/em&gt; is a rarity. A lurid pulp creation made by talented folks who seem to be enjoying themselves. You can feel it in every over-the-top minute. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider the transformation scene. A genre staple. Our protagonist, Lou, stumbles drunk into a dive bar bathroom. The change begins as he relieves himself. Lou lets out a howl. His urine turns blood red as his penis sprouts hair and inflates like a trick balloon. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a crazy shot, but not gratuitous. In leading with the genitals, WolfCop conveys the character’s transformation pain better than any werewolf film I can recall. I laughed and cringed in the same breath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not every scene is as calculated. Scenes like WolfCop tricking out his police cruiser, or foiling a gang of graffiti artists by hosing them down with his urine, are just silly. But that’s okay. The film’s only pushing the werewolf genre tropes to their natural extremes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;WolfCop&lt;/em&gt;, it’s not “What if a cop became a werewolf?” It’s “What if a drunken cop stereotype became a werewolf super cop?” The resulting mishmash of cop drama and supernatural horror is a tone-perfect, greasy hamburger of a movie that clocks in at a scant seventy nine minutes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But let’s face it, the bit about the ballooning penis already told you everything you needed to know, didn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;
</content></entry><entry><title>39. It Follows (2014) ★★☆☆☆</title><link href='https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/it-follows-2014/' /><id>https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/it-follows-2014</id><updated>2015-04-11T00:00:00-04:00</updated><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It Follows&lt;/em&gt; is the perfect white-bread horror film for folks who dismiss the genre as a step or two above pornography. It&amp;#39;s well-produced, self-aware, and devoid of any disturbing scares or gratuitous thrills. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story opens at dusk. A girl half-dressed (but not nude) in high heels flees her suburban home. She runs into the street. Her wide eyes darting back over her shoulder. She pauses, then runs back toward her house. Her father steps outside and asks if she&amp;#39;s okay. She says she is as she runs back inside. A moment later, she&amp;#39;s back out. She gets into her car, backs out of the driveway, and speeds off into the darkness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She stops at a lake and walks down to the water. She sits down with the water at her back and makes a tearful call to her parents. She apologizes for past transgressions and says she loves them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cut to the morning. The girl lies dead on the beach, her body twisted in a grotesque angle. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we meet our protagonist, Jay. She&amp;#39;s a nice girl, living in suburban Detroit. She&amp;#39;s got a younger sister, and a couple of other friends that make up her social circle. She&amp;#39;s been dating a guy named Hugh that she&amp;#39;s pretty sweet on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jay and Hugh go to the movies&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, but leave when Hugh catches sight of a woman in a yellow dress. Jay doesn&amp;#39;t see her, but a shaken Hugh insists they leave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later that night, Jay has sex with Hugh in the backseat of his car. It&amp;#39;s their first time together. Afterwards, Jay lies in the backseat talking to Jay while he fumbles around in the trunk. He finds what he&amp;#39;s looking for and climbs back into the car behind her. Hugh cuts Jay off mid-sentence by covering her mouth with a rag. Jay struggles, but soon passes out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jay wakes up tied to a wheelchair in a desolate, graffiti-covered parking garage. Hugh paces behind her, his eyes darting around. &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re not going to believe me,&amp;quot; he begins, &amp;quot;but I need to you to remember what I&amp;#39;m saying.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hugh tells Jay something is now following her. It doesn&amp;#39;t run, but it&amp;#39;s always walking in a straight line towards her. If it touches her, she&amp;#39;s dead. It can look like anyone. Someone she knows or a complete stranger. It&amp;#39;s a curse. Someone gave it to him, and now, by having sex with her, he&amp;#39;s given it to her. If the thing gets her, it goes after him again, then right down the line to wherever it started. The best thing she can do now, he says, is to have sex with someone else and pass on the curse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To prove his point, Hugh wheels Jay to the edge of the garage. In the overgrown lot below, a half-naked woman shambles toward them. Hugh waits until the thing is almost on top of them before wheeling Jay to his car. They peel out, leaving the thing behind. Hugh dumps Jay on her front lawn, still half-dressed, where her sister and friends find her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing soon comes for Jay at her house. It turns out to be invisible to those not cursed, so her friends are little help as an early warning system. Jay flees to a park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there, Jay and her friends retreat to a neighbor&amp;#39;s lake house. The next day, the thing catches up with them. Despite being invisible, the thing manhandles Jay&amp;#39;s friends when they try to stop it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, Jay flees. The film breaks the narrative circle by having Jay crash her car in a cornfield. It&amp;#39;s the same tired trope of the girl tripping while fleeing the monster. She wakes up in a hospital. Realizing she&amp;#39;s in danger, but too injured to leave, Jay has sex with her neighbor, passing the curse. The neighbor turns out to be pretty dim-witted. The thing gets him in a matter of days. Jay flees again and ends up passing the curse to a pair of random strangers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strangers don&amp;#39;t last long. It’s likely Jay never warned them, but perhaps she tried and they didn’t believe her. Either way, it&amp;#39;s soon back after Jay, but this time her friends have a plan. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They go to the local indoor pool, where Jay waits in the center of the water&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn2&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. After some tense waiting, the thing shows up, but refuses to enter the water. Instead, it throws things at Jay. One of her friends produces a handgun. He fires blind at where the creature might be. He wings another of Jay&amp;#39;s friends before putting a bullet in the creature&amp;#39;s head. The thing falls into the pool and dies trying to drag Jay under.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or does it? The film isn&amp;#39;t over. We see Jay having sex with another of her friends. The ambiguous final shot sees the pair walking hand-in-hand while someone approaches from behind. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be fair, this is a well-produced film dripping with atmosphere. The suburban locales evoke a lived-in feel and the Detroit cityscape reeks of urban decay. There&amp;#39;s no hyper-kinetic editing or gimmicky found-footage. It&amp;#39;s a slow burn. Well, maybe more like a slow singe. Given the script, I&amp;#39;m not sure this film could have been done any better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But about that script. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opening sequence reveals too much. Consider if we hadn’t seen what happened to the girl waiting by the lake.  Since the creature is only visible to the cursed, the script could have played with the concept of an unreliable narrator. Is the curse real or is Jay having a breakdown? By showing the girl dead in a such a manner, the film loses any ambiguity. The curse is real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuing the too-much-information trend, the film then explains the details of the curse. Worse still, it does it all through dialog.  Rule #1 of good storytelling: Show, don&amp;#39;t tell. Rule #1 of good horror: Nothing is scarier than the unknown. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine if the film cut from Hugh holding the rag over Jay&amp;#39;s mouth to him dumping her on the curb in front of her house. We wouldn&amp;#39;t know what had happened to her. When the creature showed up, we&amp;#39;d imagine the worst. By establishing rules and limitations, the filmmakers made the curse less scary. To borrow the film&amp;#39;s STD metaphor, it&amp;#39;s less like AIDS in the 1980&amp;#39;s and more like herpes today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which leads me to the biggest problem of all. Yes this is a horrible curse, but it&amp;#39;s manageable. Hell, the film even seems to admit as much. If the thing just walks, then couldn&amp;#39;t one just fly to someplace like Australia? Judging by the pool incident, it doesn&amp;#39;t like water, which means it probably can&amp;#39;t swim, which means you&amp;#39;re safe. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while we&amp;#39;re on the subject of nit-picks, I&amp;#39;m not sure when this film is set, but how do these kids not have internet access? Wouldn&amp;#39;t they search online for information about the curse? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, &lt;em&gt;It Follows&lt;/em&gt; offers little genuine horror, and the manufactured sense of dread wears thin well before the finale. Nor does it offer anything in the way of vicarious thrills. Its attempt to subvert slasher tropes only reinforces their value. Without them, there&amp;#39;s nothing to distract us from what’s otherwise a trite premise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a nice bit of foreshadowing, the movie playing is &lt;em&gt;Charade (1963)&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref1&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a stupid plan. They place various plugged-in electrical items around the pool’s edge. When the thing gets in the water, Jay will somehow get out and they’ll fry it. Putting aside the logic of electrocuting a semi-invisible monster, wouldn&amp;#39;t the pool have GFCI wiring?&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref2&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</content></entry><entry><title>38. The Visitor (1980) ★★☆☆☆</title><link href='https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/the-visitor-1980/' /><id>https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/the-visitor-1980</id><updated>2015-04-03T00:00:00-04:00</updated><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;As I see it, my job as a reviewer is threefold. I endeavor to describe what a given movie is about, convey a sense of the viewing experience&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and give you an idea of how I felt about it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With &lt;em&gt;The Visitor&lt;/em&gt;, I am at a loss.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film opens with a blue-eyed Christ-figure telling a story to a group of bald children. The story is about Sateen, an intergalactic criminal who fled to Earth. On Earth, Sateen mutated and developed psychic powers which he used to wreak havoc. Another alien defeated Sateen using an army of birds, but not before Sateen impregnated a slew of Earth women. Those women continued Sateen’s legacy through their children. John Huston then enters the room. He says he’s confirmed Sateen’s latest incarnation is an eight-year-old girl in Atlanta, Georgia. He’ll be leaving at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cut to Atlanta, where we meet the aforementioned girl, Katy, her mother Barbara, and her mother’s boyfriend Ray. Lance Henriksen plays Ray, continuing the film’s surprising casting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Katy is, indeed, pure evil. She’s got a demonic falcon who helps her off a few unfortunate souls who end up on her bad side, including a detective played by Glen Ford. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In time we learn that Ray is part of a shadowy cabal of Sateen worshippers that want Barbara to bear a son. This son would also possess the powers of Sateen and the cabal could harness them for its own ends. It’s not clear why they can’t use Katy, but this is a minor quibble compared to the rest of the film’s plot holes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Huston turns out to be the titular Visitor. He’s God, who’s also an alien, and presumably the one who sent the birds to destroy Sateen originally. He’s not there to kill Katy, but to take her back to his world where he’ll teach her not to be evil. Most of the time though, he hangs out on a skyscraper roof with a cadre of bald interpretive dancers. He gives his name as Jerzy Colsowicz and poses as a baby sitter in order to confront Katy. It’s an odd confrontation. The two play Pong on a giant projection screen and dance around the fact that neither of them is human.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shelly Winters plays a nanny hired by Barbara. Her scenes are notable for the instance where she slaps young Katy. According to legend, she really did slap the young girl. Hard. I like to think that it’s true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Completing some kind of bizarre casting bingo card, Sam Peckinpah turns up as Barbara’s ex-husband. She visits him for an abortion after the Sateen cabal takes matters into their own hands following Ray’s failure to impregnate Barbara. Unlike John Huston, who appears lucid and sober in his scenes, Peckinpah was allegedly a nightmare to work with and his scenes ended up dubbed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If all this seems a little disjointed and bizarre, then I have successfully conveyed a sense of the viewing experience. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The horror elements are, at times, gruesome. In a scene that would make Lucio Fulci proud, a bird pecks at Glenn Ford’s eyes, forcing him to crash his car. Other times, they’re laughably stilted. Like when Katy makes a basketball explode on Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, the film is also, at times, visually striking. An early sequence will get your hopes up. A giant sun fills an orange sky. Two cloaked figures stare each other down across a desert as a sandstorm engulfs them. Scenes like this hint at greatness, but the film can’t string enough of these moments together. It is equal parts fascinating and frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If nothing else, &lt;em&gt;The Visitor&lt;/em&gt; left me with a strong desire to read a biography of John Huston. If only to understand how the legendary auteur ended up starring in a film so bizarre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;

Three on a Match (1932) ★★★☆☆</title><link href='https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/three-on-a-match-1932/' /><id>https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/three-on-a-match-1932</id><updated>2015-03-31T00:00:00-04:00</updated><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Until a 1948 Supreme Court ruling, the five major Hollywood studios controlled the entire movie business, from production to distribution. The studios contracted performers and paid them a salary. The performers worked five days a week like anyone else. When one film wrapped, they moved to another. Thus, films like &lt;em&gt;Three on a Match&lt;/em&gt; came stock-piled with current and future stars. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story begins in the fall of 1919. The film sets the time with what&amp;#39;s now a common device, a montage of newspaper headlines.  Jack Dempsey wins the world heavyweight title. Prohibition passes. Woman&amp;#39;s suffrage passes. Then, a smaller article. The New York City schools are set to reopen after summer vacation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cut to Public School 64. The camera pans back to reveal a schoolyard teaming with children. Hundreds of them. Were they not twirling about, playing on slides and swings, it would pass for a prison yard. Here, we meet three pre-teen girls. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mary is an exhibitionist. She doesn&amp;#39;t mind her bloomers showing while she&amp;#39;s playing on the swing or the attention it gets from the boys. Much to the chagrin of class-beauty Vivian. When Mary skips class to smoke cigarettes with some boys, Vivian wants to tell on her. She&amp;#39;s dissuaded by studious Ruth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time passes with more headlines. The girls are set to graduate. Ruth is valedictorian. Vivian is voted most popular. Mary’s been in so much trouble, she’s almost held back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the ceremony, Ruth and Vivian talk about their futures. Ruth&amp;#39;s family can&amp;#39;t afford her going to high school, so she&amp;#39;s off to secretarial school so she might get a job. Vivian, however, is off to an exclusive boarding school. They both wonder what will become of Mary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More time passes. It&amp;#39;s 1925 now. The girls are teenagers. Mary, now played by Joan Blondell, is in reform school. Vivian, now played by Anne Dvorak is reading lewd romance novels to her rapt roommates in Miss Jasons School for Young Ladies. Ruth, now played by Bette Davis, toils away in secretarial school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it’s 1930. Mary sits in a beauty parlor getting her hair done. She’s telling her beautician how she ran into Ruth earlier that day and how she hasn’t seen her since their days at Public School 64. Vivian is at the same beauty parlor and overhears Mary’s mention of Public School 64. Reunited, the three women meet for lunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something I love about the pictures of this era. Running just over an hour, they had to be efficient. Here, we get ten years of backstory and characterization in under five minutes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At lunch, the girls catch up. We learn Mary has turned her life around and is now an actress who’s just gotten her first break. Ruth is working as a secretary. Vivian has married a wealthy lawyer and has a three-year-old son. Mary and Ruth envy Vivian. But Vivian is restless and bored with her life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some days later, Vivian talks her husband, Robert, into letting her travel with their son to Europe. Robert agrees, but not without some reluctance. The night they&amp;#39;re set to sail, he sees her off. After he leaves, Vivian runs into Mary, who’s now a bona-fide stage star. Mary’s there seeing another friend off. Vivian has the ship&amp;#39;s stewardess watch her son and joins Mary&amp;#39;s party. She drinks and flirts with a young rake named Michael. Before the ship leaves port, Vivian takes her son and debarks with Michael. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here, Vivian descends into a drug-and-alcohol-fueled nightmare. We see her strung out on the sofa, while her son, dirty and unwashed, begs for some healthy food. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mary, feeling responsible, visits Robert and tells him where to find Vivian. Robert reclaims his son and divorces Vivian.  Mary and Robert grow closer. On the day his divorce is final, he asks Mary to become his wife. Mary agrees. Ruth joins the family as a nanny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In between, we have the obligatory pre-code shot of a woman putting on her stockings. Here, it’s Bette Davis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Vivian has continued her fall from grace. Michael turns out to be a gambler and the two are now desperate for money to feed their habits. Vivian, waiting outside the same uptown apartment building she used to call home, begs Mary for money. After they burn through that, Michael tries extorting Robert. When that doesn’t work, Michael kidnap’s Robert’s son. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for all involved, Michael owes money to a mobster named Ace, played by Edward Arnold. Ace gets wind of the plot and muscles his way in via his henchman Harve, played by Humphrey Bogart. When the heat closes in, Harve leans on Michael to off the kid. Vivian, in a moment of lucidity during her withdrawal haze, saves her son in a startling (and over the top) fashion.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a lot of plot for 63 minutes. This is a good thing. Things move so fast we’re not given much time to consider the insanity. And make no mistake, this movie is nuts. Vivian’s fall from society lady to street-corner junkie plays like a caricature. Mary wastes her school years getting into trouble and ends up a society darling. Vivian spends her life doing what’s expected of her and sees her world collapse the first time she steps out of line. And Ruth, poor Ruth. She works, head down, as hard as she can, only to end up working for Mary. How’s that for a mixed message?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But &lt;em&gt;Three on a Match&lt;/em&gt; works despite all the crazy. Or is it because of it? I’m not sure. With a cast this good, one is hard-pressed to care. &lt;/p&gt;
</content></entry><entry><title>36. Dangerous Mission (1954) ★★☆☆☆</title><link href='https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/dangerous-mission-1954/' /><id>https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/dangerous-mission-1954</id><updated>2015-03-28T00:00:00-04:00</updated><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dangerous Mission&lt;/em&gt; isn’t a very good movie. But for some folks it may be worth a look. To explain why, I must venture into spoiler territory. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider this fair warning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film opens with a murder. We’re looking down a set of stairs into a darkened, deserted nightclub. A man sits playing a piano with his back to us. Another man appears atop the stairs. He has a gun. He sneaks down and creeps across the nightclub floor. There’s a flash of lightning and a crack of thunder from the storm outside. The piano player turns, and the gunman shoots twice. The piano player drops dead. Then we hear footsteps and a woman scream. The gunman whirls towards us and fires. We hear the sound of running and a door closing. The gunman hurries after the mystery woman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we&amp;#39;re in a posh high-rise office. Two weeks have passed. The rain hasn’t stopped. The gunman, Johnny, sits on a couch. He pokes at a toy piano, playing the same melody the piano player played before he died.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We learn that Johnny is out on bail. He’s planning to claim self-defense at the trial, but the District Attorney has a witness that could put Johnny away for a long time. Johnny thinks he knows where the witness is hiding and wants her out of the picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That’s your job,” Johnny says to a man sitting in a chair with his back to us. Now, here’s where things get confusing. They know where the witness is hiding, but they don’t know her identity. They have a guess, but they’re not sure. So the mystery hitman’s job is to fly out, rent a car, then go undercover. Mingle with the people and suss out the witness’s identity. Then kill her, but make it look like an accident. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What a hideout,” Johnny says. “No wonder we couldn’t find it until yesterday. It’s the last place in the world you’d expect anyone to hide.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cut too Glacier National Park in Montana. We see Matt Hallett, played by Victor Mature, entering the park in a rented car. The guard at the gate notice’s a gun in Matt’s glove compartment and phones it in to Chief Ranger Joe, played by William Bendix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the next half-hour or so, the film plays like a would-be suspenseful mystery. The script tries in vain to make us suspect  Matt as the hired killer. It helps that Mature has a way of talking where his entire body remains motionless except his jaw. It kept reminding me of a ventriloquist’s dummy. Certainly creepy enough to be a believable sociopath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, of course, we know better. This would-be misdirection gives Vincent Price a chance to do what he does best, play a character playing someone else. Here, he plays Paul Adams, a mob hitman playing a nature photographer. Early on, he’s all folksy smiles and good humor, but still comes off as something of a dilettante with a hint of menace. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matt and Paul both vie for the attention of the witness, Louise, played by Piper Laurie. Given that Louise is the only woman that comes close to fitting the witness’s description in the entire park, I’m not so sure it was such a good place to hide. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Louise is cordial to Paul, but finds herself drawn to Matt. In between, there’s a sub-plot involving a fugitive Indian and his daughter, an avalanche, and a forest fire.  Most of these diversions exist to exploit the film’s 3D presentation. I suppose they do a decent enough job, but they also give us the impression that Glacier Park is something of a death trap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, a little before the halfway point, Paul’s true identity is revealed. Though we see it coming, the scene isn’t without a surprise. From here, the film shifts into adventure, as Paul has to kill Louise and flee the park. But despite being a professional killer, he fails to off Louise, and she alerts the park authorities. With all the roads closed, Paul has to flee overground. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matt, now revealed as a cop working for the New York District Attorney’s office, sets out after Paul. Of course, Louise somehow ends up going with him. There’s some great location photography, and everything culminates in a showdown inside an ice fissure. It’s a scene that would have looked great shot in a real ice cave. Instead, the soundstage artifice is all the more glaring. You’ll be hard-pressed not to laugh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like I said, &lt;em&gt;Dangerous Mission&lt;/em&gt; is not a good movie. The convoluted script and uneven production values see to that. But fans of Vincent Price should enjoy him here if for nothing else than the outfit he wears for the square-dance scene.&lt;/p&gt;
</content></entry><entry><title>35. A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night (2014) ★★★★★</title><link href='https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/a-girl-walks-home-alone-at-night-2014/' /><id>https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/a-girl-walks-home-alone-at-night-2014</id><updated>2015-03-06T00:00:00-05:00</updated><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night&lt;/em&gt; bills itself as the first Iranian Vampire Western. This is misleading. Like all good movies, it transcends borders. A more accurate tagline might be “The first Persian language Vampire Western.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film takes place in Bad City, a nightmarish amalgam of urban decay and frontier isolation. It’s a place where the dead lay dumped in dried river beds like so much garbage. Its streets alternate between rows of cookie-cutter homes and desolate alleyways. In the distance, oil rigs pump up and down like crows picking at the dead earth’s skin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We follow a group of colorful characters with intersecting stories. There’s Arash, a young man who dresses in white t-shirts and pegged jeans. His prized possession is a 1957 Ford Thunderbird convertible he worked 2,191 days to afford. Arash’s father, Hossein, is a widower and heroin addict. Hossein’s dealer, Saeed has the word “SEX” tattooed across the front of his throat. Saeed is also a pimp for Atti, who’s just turned thirty and dreams of escaping the life of a street walker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weaving through these narratives is the girl. She’s a vampire. She lives in a small, one-room apartment. New-wave posters plaster the walls. At night she emerges in a pitch-black chador to prey on the city’s destitute and depraved. There is a loneliness in her that actress Sheila Vand conveys despite having little dialog. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arash and the girl’s paths cross, first in passing then again in one of the film’s cleverest scenes. Arash has been to a costume party and gotten lost walking home. He’s high on Ecstasy, staring open mouthed at a streetlight when the girl spots him. He’s wearing a Dracula costume that prompts something of a double-take by her. Their eyes meet. There is a connection. They sense the loneliness in one-another. In a near wordless scene, she takes him back to her small apartment. She puts on a record and he holds her close, wanting nothing more than the company. It is something out of a teenage fantasy, yet the scene works because the film doesn’t try to sell it. There are no speeches or orchestral swells, just the two performers and the song &lt;em&gt;Death&lt;/em&gt; from White Lies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to talk about the ending now. If what I’ve written so far has piqued your curiosity, I encourage you to give the film a look. I’d rather not spoil the ending, but if you’re still on the fence, read on and perhaps I can persuade you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, here? Okay, here we go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To appreciate why &lt;em&gt;A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night&lt;/em&gt; is a great film, we must discuss the final scene. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arash and the girl are driving out of town. Arash doesn&amp;#39;t know that she&amp;#39;s a vampire, but he knows that she killed his father. The girl doesn’t know that the man she killed was Arash’s father, but she knows he’s having second thoughts. They drive in silence. After a bit, Arash pulls the car over. He gets out and paces in the headlights. His fists clench and unclench. He runs his hands through his hair. The emotions wash over him. The girl watches in silence. We don’t fear for him, we fear for her feelings. In a Hollywood production this scene would include a monologue followed by an emotional exchange. Writer-director Ana Lily Amirpour gives us something far more powerful in the silence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In time Arash straightens, gets back in the car and pulls onto the road. They leave Bad City.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a perfect ending, and one that stuck with me long after I’d walked out of the theater. Howard Hawks said that a great movie consisted of “Three good scenes and no bad ones.” &lt;em&gt;A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night&lt;/em&gt; has this and more.&lt;/p&gt;

To the Devil a Daughter (1976) ★★☆☆☆</title><link href='https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/to-the-devil-a-daughter-1976/' /><id>https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/to-the-devil-a-daughter-1976</id><updated>2015-03-02T00:00:00-05:00</updated><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To the Devil a Daughter&lt;/em&gt; was the final film of Hammer Film Productions&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The studio rose to prominence with films such as &lt;em&gt;Curse of Frankenstein (1957)&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/horror-of-dracula-1958/&quot;&gt;Horror of Dracula (1958)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Unlike those staged, period pieces, this film is set in contemporary times and shot on location. It represented a big departure for Hammer, but it was too little too late.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story—ah, well, you’ll have to bear with me here. I’ve seen the movie twice and I’m still not sure about some of the details. According the featurette on Anchor Bay’s DVD, the filmmaker’s were writing the script as they went along. It shows in the final product. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As near as I can tell, Father Michael, played by Christopher Lee, is a priest who commits the heresy of putting his faith in man over God. To that end—and here’s where things get fuzzy—he retreats to a compound in Bavaria where he forms his own Satanic religion which masquerades as Catholicism. One of his acolytes dies during childbirth and Father Michael baptizes the baby, a girl, in her dead mother’s blood. The girl, Catherine, grows up as a nun in Father Michael’s compound. On her eighteenth birthday she travels to London. There, Father Michael will baptize her in the blood of a demon creature birthed by another of Father Michael’s acolytes&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn2&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, fortunately for humanity, Catherine’s father, Henry, has a change of heart. Henry appeals to occult novelist John Verney, played by Richard Widmark. Verney intercepts Catherine at Heathrow airport. Verney had hoped to get a book out of Henry’s story, but soon realizes the stakes are much higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Father Michael attempts to reclaim Catherine by possessing her. Verney tries to keep her safe. During the tug-of-war we’re presented with a couple of disturbing scenes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first concerns the birth of the demon creature. Picture a staged, antiseptic facsimile of a young girl&amp;#39;s bedroom. On the bed, a woman prepares to give birth. Strips of white cloth bind her wrists to the headboard and clamp her knees and ankles shut, giving the baby no escape. Arms spread, knees clenched, she lays crucified. Her face glistens with sweat as her back arches and her body spasms from another contraction. Her belly swells. Beside her, Father Michael stands waiting, smiling with eager eyes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And later, we see one of Catherine’s visions/dreams. We’re looking through her eyes. She’s pregnant and laying on her back. We see her bulging womb. Her legs are open, knees up, in the traditional birthing position. Still through her eyes, we see something crawling up from between her legs. At first glimpse it seems to be a baby, but no, it&amp;#39;s a horrid combination of baby and beast with a monstrous jaw and reptilian eyes. Covered in blood, it writhes between her legs, smearing her thighs and stomach with gore. She reaches down and strokes the creature&amp;#39;s grotesque head. Now her midsection is awash in thick, almost syrupy, blood as she gently pushes the thing back down, between her legs. Still through her eyes, we hear her moan in a mixture of agony and ecstasy as she forces the monstrosity &lt;em&gt;back up into her womb&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quality of the creature effects in this scene is laughable. And what’s worse the scene has little to do with the story. Instead, it feels like something tacked on as a reaction to &lt;em&gt;Rosemary’s Baby (1968)&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Exorcist (1973)&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it’s when you compare this film to those, that one realizes how far Hammer had fallen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a studio that, nineteen years prior, had revived the horror genre by injecting a liberal dose of gore and sex into the monster movie. The resulting films were edgy and fresh. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But time passed. By the time this film came out, Hammer’s core audience now had kids of their own. Hammer’s period monster movies were passé. They were your &lt;em&gt;parent’s&lt;/em&gt; horror movies. Even this wave of satanic themed films was on it’s nadir. Two years later &lt;em&gt;Halloween (1978)&lt;/em&gt; would usher in the slasher genre that would dominate horror for the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time Hammer woke up and tried to tap into the mainstream horror pulse, it lacked the resources to pull off a competent film. Christopher Lee does his best, but Richard Widmark looks tired and annoyed. He’s just cashing a paycheck. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The worst part is the ending. Remember how I said they were writing the script as they went along? As it turns out, they ran out of money by the time they got to the end. After an hour and a half of buildup, Verney and Father Michael square off in a mausoleum. Father Michael stands in a large circle made of blood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Says Verney, “You really think this circle will protect you, don’t you? It won’t.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But it will,” says Father Michael. “Because this circle stands upon a hill of flint, and flint is the sacred stone of Astaroth.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verney holds up a rock he literally just picked up five minutes earlier and used to club one of Father Michael’s henchman. “But this sacred stone of Astaroth has the blood of your disciple on it. Now, the demons will protect me.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verney steps into the circle and throws the rock at Father Michael, hitting him on the head. Father Michael falls to the ground and disappears. Movie over. That’s the ending. A mumbo-jumbo bit of rock-paper-scissors involving flint and the blood of a disciple. Two bits of information &lt;em&gt;never mentioned in the film before&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this was the best Hammer could do, then the studio’s death was a mercy killing&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn3&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until the studio was resurrected in 2008.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref1&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m willing to give the film the benefit of the doubt and assume Father Michael wasn’t doing this for Satan, but for his own gain. That he’s somehow brought about the birth of a demon and by baptizing Catherine in its blood, he could control its power. I know that’s reaching, but I’ve got a soft spot for Hammer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref2&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so the studio didn’t &lt;em&gt;die&lt;/em&gt;, it just produced television instead of movies. &amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref3&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</content></entry><entry><title>33. The Long Night (1947) ★★☆☆☆</title><link href='https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/the-long-night-1947/' /><id>https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/the-long-night-1947</id><updated>2015-02-26T00:00:00-05:00</updated><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Long Night&lt;/em&gt; starts well, only to lose its way in the third act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story opens with a murder. We’re inside an apartment building on the working-class side of the tracks. We hear gunshots. A man staggers out of a unit holding his gut and tumbles down the stairs. The police arrive. They attempt to extract the shooter. Through a door, the shooter says he wants to be left alone. We recognize the voice as Henry Fonda’s. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through flashbacks, we learn that Henry Fonda plays Joe, a veteran recently returned from World War II. He’s a wholesome guy. He drinks milk and uses exclamations like, “No kidding!” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day, while working as a sandblaster at the local plant, Joe meets a young girl named Jo Anne, played by Barbara Bel Geddes. Joe and Jo Anne hit it off. The film would have us believe this is natural since they’re both orphans and they’re both named Joe. They begin dating. Joe falls hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One night, Jo Anne cancels a date with Joe. She has something to do. Joe says that’s fine, but takes Jo Anne’s favorite stuffed animal hostage as a bit of insurance that she’ll see him again. It’s a nice touch that gives Joe some edge and helps make the film’s later events more plausible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joe ends up tailing Jo Anne to a dingy club where a magician is performing. Vincent Price plays the magician. We recognize him as the man who was shot during the film’s opening. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the bar, Joe meets Charlene, played by Ann Dvorak. Through Charlene, we learn the magician’s name is Maximilian. Charlene was one of his assistants. She’s just now decided to leave him, having grown tired of his manipulative ways. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joe watches Jo Anne watching Maximilian. She seems enraptured by his performance. After the show, she approaches him and he tells her to meet him at his table. Joe’s seen enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before joining Jo Anne, however, Maximilian approaches Joe and Charlene at the bar. It’s here we get our first taste of Maximilian’s condescending wit. He tries to cajole Charlene into changing her mind. Joe tells Maximilian to scram. Maximilian replies with a sarcastic grin, “My friend, there is no one I would like disagreeing with more than you. However, under the circumstances, there’s hardly any point in continuing our conversation.” Then, to Charlene, “Till tomorrow, my dear.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Charlene develops a torch for Joe. Joe, feeling hurt by Jo Anne, uses Charlene for companionship. She’s more or less emotional collateral damage by the film’s end. Dvorak makes the most of a part that exists only to show Joe turning to the dark side when he thinks he’s lost Jo Anne. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the story goes on, we learn the depths of Maximilian’s debauchery. How he’s seduced and manipulated countless naive young girls like Jo Anne. Each new bit of knowledge cuts at Joe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all builds to a showdown between Joe and Maximilian. The confrontation doesn’t disappoint. Price is great in the part despite being a decade too young. Like all of Price’s best roles, he plays a showman, one capable of immense charm on stage, and immense debauchery off stage. He talks circles around Fonda, each word dripping with condescension. Fonda plays on this, his frustration building and building until it boils over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which brings us to where we came in. And here’s where movie goes wrong. The tone shifts from noir to populist drama. The town rallies around Joe in his standoff with the police. Jo Anne fights through a never-ending mob in an effort to reach Joe. She’s knocked down by someone carrying a bicycle. Won’t the police please just let her talk to Joe, she pleads. But they won’t. Which leads to more shots of Jo Anne fighting her way through the crowd. As if this all weren’t bad enough, the film closes on a cornball line. As he’s escorted out by the police, Joe asks one of the crowd for a light. The man lights Joe’s cigarette and asks, “How you doing, Joe?” Joe replies, “I think we’ll make it, Freddy. Just about make it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No Joe, not with a disingenuous ending like that, you won’t.&lt;/p&gt;
