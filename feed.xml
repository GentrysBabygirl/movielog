      &lt;p&gt;Starting off in a rural barn, we see a young mother clutching a swaddled baby. It&amp;#39;s dark and pouring outside. Her husband has the car&amp;#39;s hood up, trying to get it started. An older boy looks at them both with a worried look. A monotone voice on the radio implores people to remain in their homes after dark. There&amp;#39;s some voiceover narration by the boy, and then the family dog takes off into the rainy darkness outside. The boy follows. At this point, we can almost count the horror tropes. Indeed, &lt;em&gt;Stake Land&lt;/em&gt; doesn&amp;#39;t start well.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;It gets better. It seems the world is now overrun by the undead. The boy, Martin, meets Mister, an enigmatic loner who seems to know everything about killing vampires. Mister even pulls the fangs out of his kills and saves them like scalps. This little quirk may be the only reason the film uses vampires instead of zombies. Anyway, Mister takes Martin under his wing and the two set out for New Eden, a fabled promised land to the north. Standing in their way is a white supremacist cult that uses vampires as kind of a chemical weapon. &lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;Despite the shaky opening, &lt;em&gt;Stake Land&lt;/em&gt; is a solid little genre piece. It&amp;#39;s dark, but not without some nice touches of black comedy. The production values and performances belie the film&amp;#39;s all but straight-to-video release. Sure, the voiceover narration is unnecessary, but it&amp;#39;s easy enough to ignore. Now if only they could have somehow gotten Warren Oates to play Mister...&lt;/p&gt;

      12. Welcome Back
    </title>

    <content type='html'>
      &lt;p&gt;Hey there, constant reader. Frank here. &lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;It looks like I fell off the review wagon, what with my last post coming over a year ago. Sorry about that. See, I enjoy writing about movies, but I enjoy watching them even more. The trouble is that I can&amp;#39;t do both at the same time. So the more movies I watched, the more my to-review list grew.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;I also spent a lot of time tinkering with this site. My day job is software development, and I love coding almost as much as I love movies. So I went through several design iterations. I added splash images, transitions, and client-side sorting and filtering. The site looked pretty damn sweet. But while I was adding all those features, you know what I wasn&amp;#39;t doing? Writing reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;Which brings us to today. The top of my to-review list is a movie I saw almost two years ago. And there&amp;#39;s over 200 movies after that one.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;m declaring review bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s that mean? Well, in a nutshell, I&amp;#39;m starting over. I&amp;#39;ve still got the list (over in the &lt;a href=&quot;/viewings&quot;&gt;viewing log&lt;/a&gt;) of everything I&amp;#39;ve seen since January 1st 2012, but I&amp;#39;m starting over on reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;One of my goals when I started the site was to become a better writer by forcing myself to write more. But writing a review for every movie I watch isn&amp;#39;t going to help if the reviews are crap.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;And a lot of them were crap.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;They were crap because I churned them out to clear the queue. I watch too many movies to review them all. So now, instead of trying to review every movie I watch, I&amp;#39;ll aim for one review a week. &lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;That should give me enough time for three drafts per review. Most of the previous reviews were first draft efforts. Three drafts gives a chance to polish while still forcing me to publish the thing instead of tinkering with it for draft after draft. &lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;Finally, to bring the focus back to the writing I redesigned the site again. The splash images and posters are gone, because finding and prepping them took a lot of time. Time better spent writing.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;So welcome back, constant reader. I hope you&amp;#39;ll give me a second chance. We&amp;#39;ve got close to a hundred years of cinema to cover and I&amp;#39;m pretty excited.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s get started&lt;/p&gt;

      11. The Thin Man (1934) ★★★★½
    </title>

    <content type='html'>
      &lt;p&gt;Eccentric inventor Clyde Wynant is preparing to go into seclusion to work on a new project when he’s interrupted by a visit from his daughter Dorothy (O&amp;#39;Sullivan) who announces her engagement. Wynant hurries her out, but promises to return in time for her wedding. Wynant continues his preparations and discovers that the $50,000 in bonds he’d earmarked as a wedding present for Dorothy are missing. He storms over to the apartment of his mistress Julia, catching her in the arms of another man in the process. Wynant accuses her of the theft and threatens to turn her over to the police. Three months later Dorothy hasn’t heard from her father. While out at a restaurant, she recognizes former detective Nick Charles (Powell) and approaches him for help. Nick–happy in his new life of leisure with his heiress wife Nora (Loy)–is reluctant to get involved, but when circumstances pin a pair of murders on the still missing Wynant, Nick steps in and uncovers a buried skeleton along with a labyrinthine array of suspects and motives. The mystery culminates with New York’s finest corralling all the suspects to a dinner party thrown by Nick and Nora, where Nick ferrets out the true killer.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;The talky opening betrays the film’s B-movie production, with the script throwing enough plot and characters at us to fill an entire movie, but once Powell makes his appearance–in a posh restaurant bar, demonstrating to an impromptu-crowd how various cocktails demand unique shaking rhythms (Manhattans to a Fox-Trot, Bronxs to a Two-Step, and Dry Martinis to a Waltz)–the dialog goes from stilted to fluid, with Powell gliding through the film as the witty urbane charmer we all believe ourselves to be after a few drinks. There’s little real danger and the entire plot is little more than a MacGuffin to support Powell’s lyrical banter, which reaches it’s apex during the iconic dinner party scene. As Loy says, “It’s the best dinner I’ve ever listened to.”&lt;/p&gt;

      10. The Blob (1988) ★★☆☆☆
    </title>

    <content type='html'>
      &lt;p&gt;Rebel loner Kevin Dillon subs for clean-cut Steve McQueen and the army isn’t quite the white knight it was in the 1958 original, but this remake hits all the same plot points as a group of teenagers struggle to save a disbelieving small town from a gelatinous ooze that consumes its victims while adding to its ever-increasing mass. Where this entry declares its creative independence is via its memorable and gruesome special effects. This blob doesn’t just assimilate its victims, it digests them.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;Director Chuck Russell shows a sure hand establishing the small-town atmosphere, and the cast is competent, making for a passable popcorn monster flick, but the script’s insistence on recreating the scenes from the original film while still tweaking the story results in characters often acting with no clear motivation short of advancing the plot. While not a total wash, it is disappointing, especially given that the ending’s obligatory sequel setup is so promising.&lt;/p&gt;

      9. The Thing (1982) ★★★★½
    </title>
    <link href='http://movielog.frankshowalter.com/reviews/the-thing-1982' />

      &lt;p&gt;At a remote Antarctic research station, a group of scientists and their helicopter pilot (Russell) discover they’ve been infiltrated by a parasitic alien organism that assimilates other life forms and subsequently imitates them. After calculating that the alien would assimilate all of humanity within three years it reached civilization, one of the scientists destroys the station’s communications and transport equipment, stranding the crew with the monster. Tensions rise and the men start to turn on one another, unsure who’s a man, and who’s a thing.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;Ostensibly a remake of Howard Hawks&amp;#39; The Thing from Another World (1951), Carpenter’s film is actually a superior adaptation of the source material (John W. Campbell, Jr.’s novella, Who Goes There?), delivering a near-perfect mix of psychological horror and monster movie set pieces. The special effects are gruesomely inventive. We see one character defibrillating another, only to have the man’s chest open and chomp the would-be rescuer’s arms off at the elbows. Yet, the movie isn’t just about the monster. There’s a very Hawks-ian feel to the characters and their fragile camaraderie, that, along with the desolate location photography and weathered set design, earns our buy-in right away. While there’s no way of knowing how Hawks would have reacted to the amped up gore, he certainly would have appreciated the Carpenter’s unsentimental approach to capturing the men’s working lives and relationships with one-another, as well as the honest ending.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Arquette plays Kristen, a teenager tormented by nightmares of a badly burned man with razors for fingers. When she wakes from one of her dreams to find her wrists slashed, her parents–believing it a suicide attempt–commit her to a local psychiatric hospital. There she meets a group of teens plagued by similar nightmares and Nancy (played by Langenkamp) a survivor of the first film who’s now a doctor. Nancy tells Kristen and the other children that they–like herself–are the last descendants of the men and women who originally killed the man in their dreams: Freddy Krueger. Nancy also breaks the bad news that dying a dream with Krueger equals death in the real world. Later, Kristen falls asleep and encounters Krueger. In a panic, she pulls Nancy into her dream, unaware she could to do so. The two manage to escape Krueger. Sensing an opportunity, Nancy teaches the kids how to fight back in their dreams, but Krueger manages to take one child hostage, rendering him comatose in the real world. Nancy mounts a rescue mission, using Kristen to pull all the kids into a group dream and final showdown with Krueger.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;This third installment in the franchise veers toward dark fantasy, with Krueger claiming victims in a variety of imaginative, fx-heavy ways. Early on he’s a giant snake looking to swallow his victim whole, later he’s a giant-sized puppet-master, manipulating his victim’s tendons like a marionette. There’s even a scene where he’s a Ray Harryhausen-esque stop-motion skeleton. The inventive visuals help to mitigate the flat dialog and wooden performances. The worst of which belongs to Arquette, who does little more than scream. At everything. All the time.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;In the late 21st century, archeologist Rapace discovers a series of identical star charts amongst the ruins of several disparate ancient civilizations. Viewing this as an invitation from humanity’s forerunners, the elderly chair of the massive Weyland corporation funds an expedition to follow the charts deep into space to an earth-sized moon orbiting a massive planet. The crew travel in stasis, watched over by David, an android played by Fassbender who passes the time watching the dreams of the various crew-members and Lawrence of Arabia (1962). Upon landing, the crew discover the remains of what appears to be an ancient alien species with DNA that matches humans. Things go downhill fast, though, and the search for knowledge quickly devolves into a struggle for survival, as the Weyland corporation’s hidden motives and the true nature of the alien species become clear.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;More bombastic and action-driven than director Ridley Scott’s Alien (1979), but less so than James Cameron’s Aliens (1986), Scott’s return to the Alien universe is a philosophical sci-fi horror. The visual effects are amazing, with immersive environments that manage to impart feelings of dread and awe simultaneously. The central theme of man’s innate desire to understand his creation provides a great hook, though the film’s lack of concrete answers will be frustrating for some. This isn’t a film about where we came from, but one about the need to ask the question, as best illustrated by Fassbender’s character, David, an android who views himself superior to humans and thus can’t understand the desire to meet one’s maker. Which begs the question: What if, upon meeting our creator, we were unimpressed?&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;In a desolate church cemetery, Father Thomas hangs himself from an old oak tree. Medium Mary Woodhouse (MacColl) sees the act during a seance, convulses violently and drops dead from shock. Nosing for a story, reporter Peter Bell (George) attends Mary’s funeral. As the mourners trickle away, Peter lingers and Mary awakens in her coffin, very much alive and frantic to escape. Peter hears her scratching at the coffin lid–or likely thinks he does, thanks to Mary’s psychic talents–and frees her. Mary tells Peter about her vision, and how Thomas’s suicide was a sacrifice intended to open the gates of Hell. Peter is skeptical but curious, and agrees to travel with Mary to where she believes the gate to exist, a remote New England town called Dunwich. In Dunwich, people are starting to disappear thanks to the now undead Thomas, who claims a pair of teens in a horrific–albeit memorable–sequence. Peter and Mary arrive and eventually connect with the few locals with enough sense and luck to stay alive. Together, they head for the cemetery in a last-ditch effort to close the gate and avoid the apocalypse.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;Fulci’s film, the first of his unofficial Gates of Hell trilogy (followed by The Beyond (1981) and The House by the Cemetery (1981)) is a blend of mystery and horror with MacColl and George trying to track down the source of her vision while Fabrizio Jovine’s Father Thomas racks up the victims in increasingly gory ways. The supernatural aspects of the plot defy logical explanation, with Jovine appearing and disappearing at will. It’s not a matter of lazy screenwriting, but a calculated measure to show the characters battling forces they can’t possibly understand. The resulting chaos only adds to the gut-wrenching sense of dread that Fulci cultivates throughout the picture, making this a must-see for horror fans and 80’s gore aficionados.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Set on an army base during peacetime, the film follows Sergeant Eustis Clay (McQueen) and his idol, Master Sergeant Maxwell Slaughter (Gleason). Clay cooks up a series of dim-witted get-rich-quick schemes, which draw the ire of rival Sergeant Lenahan and MP Priest, frequently requiring some degree of intervention from Slaughter to keep Clay out of trouble. Clay dreams of going into business with Slaughter when their enlistments end, but Slaughter is comfortable with the easy life he’s built for himself in the peacetime army. Sensing Slaughter’s reluctance, Clay tries to temp him with the lures of civilian life by setting him up on a blind date with ditzy teenager Bobby Jo Pepperdine (Weld). Slaughter navigates the situation with tact, settling into a fatherly relationship with Pepperdine that somewhat mirrors his relationship with Clay. Things turn dark when Clay gets word that his beloved dog has died, and Lenahan and Priest bait a drunken Clay into a two-against-one barroom brawl that ends in tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;Given that his most iconic performances feature a minimal amount of dialog, it’s jarring to see McQueen in such a motor-mouth role, but he plays well opposite Gleason, whose disarming performance makes the film. And what an odd little film it is. After opening like a sitcom it gradually morphs into a drama, reflecting McQueen’s character’s own gradual maturity. Kudos to screenwriters Edwards and Richlin for keeping Goldman’s ending. Without it, the film would be a forgettable popcorn piece. As it turned out, the film was forgotten anyway, having the ill fortune to open five days after JFK’s assassination.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Lane plays a Linda, an ambitious secretary out to climb the corporate ladder. Just as her career takes off, she marries Jimmy, an ex-footballer from Princeton played by Morris, who demands she leave her job. Linda reluctantly agrees, and several months later they’ve settled into a bland suburban existence with Linda playing the role of dutiful housewife. Still ambitious, Linda arranges a promotion for Jimmy and leaves him when he turns it down, moving back to the city and resuming her career. Soon, she’s near the top of the ladder, working long nights alongside fellow advertising executive Harry, played by Humphrey Bogart. Jimmy returns to the city alone and throws himself into his work, turning into the driven man Linda always wanted him to be. As Harry makes his feelings for Linda clear, Linda realizes she’ll have to chose between Harry and Jimmy.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;Let’s get this out of the way: there is one, and only one, reason to endure Men Are Such Fools: to see Humphrey Bogart look utterly ridiculous in his unitard swimsuit. A fast-forward button can make this a much more pleasant endeavor, as the rest of the film is awful. Neither of the leads is likable. Lane starts out okay, but as soon as Morris makes his entrance, she goes downhill. You see, Morris&amp;#39; character is a total ass. He bullies Lane’s character at every turn, sabotages her career, and disregards her hopes and dreams. Thus, when Lane’s character suddenly goes giddy and agrees to marry him, you can’t help but lose any sympathy for her. Things get better–briefly–when Bogart shows up. You’re practically screaming at Lane to go for him, but instead she only uses him to get back with the lunky Morris. Despite the title, the film makes it pretty clear that it’s the women, not men who are the fools. Was this really how it worked in 1938?&lt;/p&gt;
