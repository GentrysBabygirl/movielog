The Devil Rides Out (1968) ★★★★☆</title><link href='http://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/the-devil-rides-out-1968/' /><id>http://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/the-devil-rides-out-1968</id><updated>2015-01-26T00:00:00-05:00</updated><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Some films have no business working as well as they do. &lt;em&gt;The Devil Rides Out&lt;/em&gt; is one such film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set in 1929, the story opens with the dashing Duke de Richleau awaiting the arrival of his good friend, Rex Van Ryn. The Duke is played by Hammer stalwart Christopher Lee who, in a rare change of pace, gets to play the hero and does a fine job of it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rex arrives piloting his own biplane, which is the extent of the characterization the script allots him.  After landing, he and the Duke set out to call on their young friend, Simon. What they find upon arriving at Simon&amp;#39;s palatial house alarms the Duke. It seems Simon has fallen in with a group of Satanists led by the sinister Mocata, played by Charles Gray. As the Duke says, “Simon is playing the most dangerous game known to mankind.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lee’s dialog is full of lines like that. They should induce groans, but Lee pulls them off with flair. He opens the commentary track on the DVD saying that he’s largely responsible for the film being made. He was a big fan of the novel by Dennis Wheatley and brought the book to the attention of studio executives. His performance is reminiscent of Peter Cushing’s turn as Van Helsing in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/horror-of-dracula-1958/&quot;&gt;Horror of Dracula (1958)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and his admiration of the source material shines through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opposite Lee, Gray delivers a smooth, understated performance that’s almost as magnetic as Lee&amp;#39;s&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Consider the scene where he calls on the Duke&amp;#39;s niece in an attempt to extract Simon. She makes to throw him out, but he leaves of his own accord saying, “I&amp;#39;m leaving. I shall not be back. But something will.” He pauses for a moment then adds, “Tonight. Something will come for Simon and the girl.” His tone is casual, not threatening, and all the more menacing for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the supernatural elements, &lt;em&gt;The Devil Rides Out&lt;/em&gt;  isn’t really a horror movie at all&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn2&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. It’s a terrific pulp adventure. Sure, the characters are archetypes, and the stilted dialog may induce a wry smirk, but the film rolls along at such a good clip, we’ve hardly a moment to care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gray had just starred in &lt;em&gt;You Only Live Twice (1967)&lt;/em&gt; but Hammer&amp;#39;s first choice for Mocata was another Bond alumnus: Gert Fröbe, Goldfinger himself!&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref1&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fearing moviegoers would think &lt;em&gt;The Devil Rides Out&lt;/em&gt; was a western, Twentieth Century Fox changed the title to &lt;em&gt;The Devils’ Bride&lt;/em&gt; for the USA theatrical release.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref2&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

The One I Love (2014) ★★★★☆</title><link href='http://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/the-one-i-love-2014/' /><id>http://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/the-one-i-love-2014</id><updated>2015-01-25T00:00:00-05:00</updated><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Warning: There be spoilers here. It&amp;#39;s not possible to talk about &lt;em&gt;The One I Love&lt;/em&gt; in a meaningful way without them. But it’s a movie best seen with an open mind. So I encourage you, if you haven&amp;#39;t seen it, to do so. It&amp;#39;s not perfect, but the first two acts are brilliant and it&amp;#39;s original enough to warrant a look. Go ahead, I&amp;#39;ll wait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back? Okay, here we go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Duplass and Elisabeth Moss play Ethan and Sophie, a young couple on the brink of divorce. They&amp;#39;ve drifted apart. Their counselor sends them to a remote retreat for a weekend getaway. He believes it’s just what they need to reconnect and rediscover one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The retreat turns out to be a sizable country estate, complete with pool and guest house. Ethan and Sophie arrive and discover they&amp;#39;re the only people present. They settle in, have a nice dinner, and smoke some marijuana.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sophie wanders over to the guest house.  Ethan joins her. They laugh, talk and have a wonderful time. The best they&amp;#39;ve had in years. They have sex. Later, Sophie heads back to the main house to grab some things. Inside, she&amp;#39;s surprised to find Ethan lying on the couch. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She laughs and asks how he&amp;#39;s beaten her back. Ethan looks confused. He&amp;#39;s just woken up. Sophie stops laughing. She asks him why he&amp;#39;s acting like this after they just has sex. Ethan looks at her with bewilderment. He tells her he&amp;#39;s been asleep on the couch since they smoked the marijuana. Sophie storms off, furious at Ethan&amp;#39;s unfunny joke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ethan wanders over to the guest house and falls asleep on the couch there. In the middle of the night, Sophie joins him. They snuggle. Ethan wakes to find Sophie making breakfast. Including bacon. Sophie hates bacon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up to this point, the film has cultivated a subtle aura of menace. The long shadow-filled shots of Sophie walking back to the house and through the empty kitchen wouldn&amp;#39;t seem out of place in a home invasion thriller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now we&amp;#39;ve got an inkling of what&amp;#39;s going on, and to the film&amp;#39;s credit, it doesn&amp;#39;t drag things out.  Ethan and Sophie soon realize that when one of them enters the guest house alone, they&amp;#39;re greeted by a doppelgänger of the other. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They run. Again, credit to the film. It&amp;#39;s what most folks would do. But then Ethan and Sophie get to thinking about it. Especially Sophie. They talk. The film&amp;#39;s tone shifts from menacing to quirky. Sophie suggests going back. Weren&amp;#39;t they there to try new things? Ethan agrees. They return to the retreat and set some ground rules for the guest house. Fifteen minute sessions, no intimate activity. Total honesty. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, these rules soon go out the window. Sophie begins sneaking out to see the other Ethan. Ethan ends up impersonating his doppelgänger in order to sleep with Sophie. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, Ethan gets some voicemails from friends and family members. The messages suggest that Ethan made a series of calls in the middle of the night asking random questions about his past. Some of his clothes seem to have gone missing as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon the doppelgängers confront Ethan and Sophie as a couple. The four try to have a nice dinner, but Ethan&amp;#39;s suspicion and resentment bubble over. He storms off to the guest house. Once inside, he finds he can&amp;#39;t get out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In time, Sophie&amp;#39;s doppelgänger arrives. Then the film falls apart. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up to this point, the doppelgängers felt like a novel device the script employed to visualize Ethan and Sophie&amp;#39;s perceptions of one another. This sort of thing could feel like a gimmick and veer into into cheesy fantasy, but the film stays grounded by focusing on the harsh realities of trying to make a relationship work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To this end, the doppelgängers require no explanation. They exist to serve the story. The film even floats this notion, suggesting that some things “Just happen.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the movie isn&amp;#39;t confident enough to leave it at that. And so Sophie&amp;#39;s doppelgänger reveals the truth to Ethan. Her and Doppelgänger Ethan were another couple sent to the retreat like Ethan and Sophie, but now they&amp;#39;re trapped. The only way they can leave is to break up Ethan and Sophie so they can take their place. But something&amp;#39;s gone wrong. The other Ethan has fallen in love with the real Sophie. He&amp;#39;s planning to leave with her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that wealth of exposition, the plot kicks in. Doppelgänger Sophie lets Ethan out of the guest house and distracts Doppelgänger Ethan (by posing as the real Sophie) so that Ethan can warn Sophie. When Sophie refuses to leave with him, Doppelgänger Ethan tries leaving by himself. An invisible wall knocks him cold. Ethan and Sophie leave. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next we see, they&amp;#39;re lying in bed giggling. Sophie gets up and offers to make breakfast, asking if Ethan wants bacon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film name-drops &lt;em&gt;The Twilight Zone&lt;/em&gt; but the first two acts are more reminiscent of David Lynch&amp;#39;s work.  Like Lynch&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;Lost Highway (1997)&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Mulholland Dr. (1999)&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The One I Love&lt;/em&gt; explores the subject of identity through a strange, inexplicable event. But the difference is that in Lynch&amp;#39;s films, the character&amp;#39;s motivations are never explicitly verbalized. If you define them, the rest of the story must serve them. When it doesn’t, you have plot holes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And boy does &lt;em&gt;The One I Love&lt;/em&gt; have a lot of them. The whole film does&amp;#39;t make any sense, really. What was the point of imprisoning couples there? Why transform the previous couples into doppelgängers of the next ones? Why can they only leave after the other two have broken up? Why did their therapist send them in the first place? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite all this, &lt;em&gt;The One I Love&lt;/em&gt; impressed me. It&amp;#39;s a brilliant concept that&amp;#39;s handled with the perfect tone. That it goes off the rails at the end doesn&amp;#39;t detract from the great performances and it&amp;#39;s biting insight into relationships. The plot holes don’t ruin the movie, they just handicap it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, just imagine if it didn&amp;#39;t try to explain the doppelgängers. Imagine if the scene where Ethan hears the other couple&amp;#39;s voices turning into his and Sophie&amp;#39;s was left out. Imagine if when Ethan confronted doppelgänger Sophie about not being real, she just sat and stared at him with that slightly unnatural smile. Then cut to the scene of Ethan and Sophie back home in bed laughing and Sophie getting up to make breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose this ending would leave some portion of the audience wanting. Lynch’s films are famous for that. They’re like lego sets. They provide the audience with the building blocks of a story, but leave it to the viewer to create their own interpretation and meaning. Unfortunately, &lt;em&gt;The One I Love&lt;/em&gt; is less like a set of legos and more like a puzzle. One that&amp;#39;s missing a few pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
</content></entry><entry><title>24. The Angry Hills (1959) ★★☆☆☆</title><link href='http://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/the-angry-hills-1959/' /><id>http://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/the-angry-hills-1959</id><updated>2015-01-17T00:00:00-05:00</updated><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Angry Hills&lt;/em&gt; starts well enough. It&amp;#39;s 1941. Robert Mitchum plays Mike Morrison, an American Correspondent who has just arrived in Greece. The Nazis are preparing to take the country and Mike plans to be on the next plane out. A member of the Greek resistance presents Mike with a list of Nazi collaborators. He urges Mike to take the list to British Intelligence. Mike declines, saying he doesn’t want to get involved. Later, while out with a friend, Mike discovers the list in his jacket.  Mike attempts to unload the list to another Greek agent, but Gestapo agents are already on Mike&amp;#39;s tail. They force him to flee through the darkened back streets of Athens. Mike escapes by hitching a ride on a British convoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, so good. But then the film goes off the rails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The script jumps ahead. We learn that the Germans bombed the British Convoy and that Mike survived thanks to some fishermen who took him to a remote village. &lt;em&gt;Then&lt;/em&gt; the film jumps back and we see the convoy get bombed. Then we&amp;#39;re back with Mike in a small Greek village.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These village scenes are dull and uninspiring. Stilted melodrama replaces suspense. A young, hotheaded female villager named Eleftheria nurses Mike back to health. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once Mike is healthy, the film devolves into a clumsy wartime adventure. The villagers ask Mike to lead them on a raid of a Nazi supply depot. Because, who better to lead a guerrilla raid in the Greek countryside than an American journalist? While they&amp;#39;re planning the raid, a British soldier shows up, says he&amp;#39;d like to help, learns all the details about the raid, then leaves. No one is concerned. Of course, the raid goes bad. The Nazi&amp;#39;s slaughter all the men save Mike and another, who manage to get away. When they can&amp;#39;t understand what happened, we almost laugh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a bit, Mike and Eleftheria travel to a convent where Mike&amp;#39;s given passage back to Athens. Once there, things get a little better, as the film shifts again, this time to a heist picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lisa, a widowed British spy, is Mike&amp;#39;s contact in Athens. The Gestapo gets wind of this and kidnaps Lisa&amp;#39;s children. She&amp;#39;s to turn over Mike if she wants to see her kids again. She sets Mike up, but changes her mind at the last minute. To rescue her children, she makes a deal with a local underworld figure named Chesney, played by Sebastian Cabot. Chesney double crosses the local Nazi agents while Lisa distracts the chief officer. It&amp;#39;s a satisfactory ending, but one in which Mike is superfluous. By this point the list is all but forgotten, having been supplanted by Lisa&amp;#39;s children as the motivating factor. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a lot of good here. The film looks great, especially when it&amp;#39;s in Athens. The location photography, and rich use of shadows give it a terrific sense of atmosphere. The cast is solid too. Mitchum is great as a reluctant hero. Stanley Baker is even better as the Gestapo Agent charged with capturing Mitchum. Cap it off with Sebastian Cabot channeling Sidney Greenstreet in the best way possible and this should have been a good movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, in the end, &lt;em&gt;The Angry Hills&lt;/em&gt; isn&amp;#39;t really a movie at all.  It starts as a Hitchcockian spy thriller. But before it can get going, it drops that premise and sets up an action picture. And before &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; can pay off, it tries out a heist picture. Had it followed through on any of these premises, it would likely have turned out better&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Instead where given the beginning of one movie, the middle of another, and the end of yet another. Quite a disappointment given the talent involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, maybe not the wartime action premise. That was just silly.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref1&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</content></entry><entry><title>23. Rachel and the Stranger (1948) ★★☆☆☆</title><link href='http://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/rachel-and-the-stranger-1948/' /><id>http://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/rachel-and-the-stranger-1948</id><updated>2015-01-15T00:00:00-05:00</updated><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Rachel and the Stranger&lt;/em&gt;, William Holden plays David Harvey. David is a pioneer farmer living with his young son Davey in the Ohio wilderness. David&amp;#39;s wife Susan died the previous year, sinking him into depression. It&amp;#39;s only after finding Davey using a page from one of his school books as a sail for a toy boat, that David resolves to find a new wife. Not for love, but because he knew how important it was to Susan that Davey not grow up &amp;quot;woodsy&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David travels to the nearby stockade and consults the Parson. The Parson suggests David buy the contract of a bond woman named Rachael. David likes the idea of a servant. A woman but not a wife.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the Parson says, &amp;quot;Decent church folk don&amp;#39;t live together, man and woman, under the same roof without marriage.&amp;quot; So David marries Rachael and takes her back to his farm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though he is distant, David is not cruel to her. She sleeps in the bed, David sleeps in another room on the floor. Rachael is timid, but works to endear herself. David takes no notice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Davey, however, is downright cruel. When she tells him she was brought there to give him his schooling and sort of mother him, Davey spits back, &amp;quot;The devil it was! You&amp;#39;re a bond slave is all!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things change when Jim, a family friend played by Robert Mitchum, arrives. Jim&amp;#39;s a hunter and tracker. He was a one time suitor of Susan, and both he and David were surprised she chose David over him. Jim, it seems, has decided to settle down, and takes an instant interest in Rachel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jim is attentive and charming. David gets jealous. Both men begin to vie for Rachel’s attention, culminating in a fist-fight that leads to Rachel leaving them both. They go after her. There&amp;#39;s an obligatory Indian attack, then it&amp;#39;s over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three leads are solid. Young and Holden are convincing, and Mitchum is great as a laconic woodsman. But this is not a good movie. It takes us for simpletons incapable of picking up any subtlety. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider when, after arriving in the cabin, Rachael is clearing the table. David and Davey are talking. Davey says he won&amp;#39;t be getting any music lessons. We see Rachael pause. This should have been it. Instead, the film cuts to a drawn-out close-up of Rachael. We see her look off screen, open her mouth to say something, then close it and look down at Davey. Davey looks back, daring her to talk. She doesn&amp;#39;t and walks away. It&amp;#39;s a ten second scene that should have played out in an instant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The script is clumsy too. Consider the scene where David and Davey are out working. They hear a turkey call. Davey whines abut wanting to go take a shot at the bird. David grabs Davey and dives to the ground. The turkey call is the signal of the Shawnee Indians, he says. Of course, it&amp;#39;s just Jim, but when he steps out of the woods to greet David he tells them there&amp;#39;s signs of Shawnee up to the north. We haven&amp;#39;t heard a thing about Indians up to this point, but now the script mentions Shawnee four times in the span of two minutes. There isn&amp;#39;t a mention of them again until they attack in the finale. This scene, like the Indian attack itself, feels tacked-on and forced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#39;s how most of this film works. Characters don&amp;#39;t act organically, they act &lt;em&gt;conveniently&lt;/em&gt;. Rachael is a reserved mouse until Jim and David get into a fight, then she announces she&amp;#39;s leaving. Rachael has to leave so that David can win her back. Davey spends most of the film spitting venom at Rachael, but after she makes him a meal one night, he&amp;#39;s happy to have her as his mother. Davey has to like her to allow David to fall in love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And speaking of Davey, he&amp;#39;s an awful character. He&amp;#39;s whiny and obstinate. We&amp;#39;re given no reason to like him. Yes, he misses his mother. But the way he&amp;#39;s presented, one suspects he was annoying long before Susan departed this earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a kernel of a good story here, and the three leads are more than capable of pulling it off. But the hackneyed melodramatic fable they&amp;#39;re given to work with is frustrating at best, and annoying at worst. The adult themes of intimacy and emotional neglect belie a trite narrative that&amp;#39;s presented in a ham-handed and condescending manner. Given the talent involved, we deserve better.&lt;/p&gt;
</content></entry><entry><title>22. Locke (2013) ★★★★☆</title><link href='http://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/locke-2013/' /><id>http://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/locke-2013</id><updated>2015-01-14T00:00:00-05:00</updated><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Locke&lt;/em&gt; is not a great film, but it is a good one. If you&amp;#39;re on the fence about seeing it, do so. Don&amp;#39;t read any further, as we&amp;#39;re going to talk about plot and this movie works best the less you know going in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still here? Okay, here we go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Locke&lt;/em&gt; opens with a wide shot of a construction site. It&amp;#39;s dark. Spotlights illuminate a massive foundation hole. Early the next morning, they will pour the concrete. It will be the largest commercial pour in Europe. Ivan Locke (Tom Hardy) is the construction manager in charge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ivan gets into his car. He pulls away from the curb and makes a call. He gets a woman&amp;#39;s voicemail. He tells her he&amp;#39;s gotten her message and that he&amp;#39;s on his way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the film unfolds we learn that Ivan is traveling to London from Birmingham. We also learn the circumstances surrounding the trip. Last year he had a one night stand while away on a job. The first and only time he&amp;#39;s strayed in fifteen years of marriage. But the woman, Bethan, became pregnant. Now, the baby has come early and she&amp;#39;s gone into labor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the film happens in near real-time, as Ivan juggles a series of calls. We learn more about him. He is both diligent and pragmatic. The kind of man who makes checklists but is able to adapt to unforeseen circumstances. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so it is with a deliberate logic that he approaches his current situation. He has fathered a child. Now he must do right by it. A deep-rooted psychological need drives him. Ivan&amp;#39;s father abandoned him. Ivan refuses to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film doles out this information in small bits as it unfolds. Each nugget raises the emotional stakes and increases the story’s tension. In time, Ivan loses his job, his family and his home. He accepts these events with a calm detachment. These are the consequences of his actions. He compartmentalizes them. He holds to his logic. He must be there for his child. Early on, when Bethan asks if he loves her, Ivan replies &amp;quot;How can I? I don&amp;#39;t know you.&amp;quot; His tone is not cruel. It is the voice of a man trying to convince her of a truth he needs to believe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watching Ivan’s world unravel is a compelling journey. Tom Hardy holds our attention from the very first scene. We want to learn more about his character. Through his eyes and inflection, Hardy conveys a character struggling to contain a sea of emotions. Setting the entire film in Ivan’s car doesn’t feel like a stunt, it feels natural. It adds to the claustrophobic sense of desperation that the film cultivates. By the end, we’re hanging on every word.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But about that end. Just as abruptly as it began, the film is over. Ivan&amp;#39;s world has changed and he heads off to what will be, for him, a new life. I didn&amp;#39;t like this ending, but I&amp;#39;m not sure how I would change it. It felt anti-climatic. Not enough to ruin the film, but enough that it left me wanting. But perhaps that&amp;#39;s the point. Just like Ivan, we’re left with an odd sense of detachment.&lt;/p&gt;
</content></entry><entry><title>21. She Couldn't Say No (1954) ★★★☆☆</title><link href='http://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/she-couldnt-say-no-1954/' /><id>http://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/she-couldnt-say-no-1954</id><updated>2015-01-10T00:00:00-05:00</updated><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Had it dared to be as provocative as it&amp;#39;s title, &lt;em&gt;She Couldn&amp;#39;t Say No&lt;/em&gt; might have been something special. As is, it’s not a bad film, but it is something of a let-down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story follows an oil heiress named Korby Lane, played by Jean Simmons. Korby travels to the small town of Progress in rural Arkansas. Once there, she begins anonymously doling out large sums of money to the townsfolk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She also takes an interest in Doc Sellers, played by Robert Mitchum. Doc susses out Korby&amp;#39;s motivations, and tries to dissuade her. But Korby is stubborn. Her generosity backfires. Flush with cash, the town vet pulls up stakes, leaving the local farmers in a lurch. So does the owner of the boarding house where Korby&amp;#39;s been staying. The town drunk, played by the always charming Arthur Hunnicutt, almost dies of alcohol poisoning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the town descends into chaos, Korby realizes the error of her ways. She comes clean as the town&amp;#39;s beneficiary and says there&amp;#39;ll be no more money. Korby and Doc get together and we&amp;#39;re led to believe the town is more-or-less back to normal. Of course, we know that can&amp;#39;t be true, but this is part of how the film lets us down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a film built on a solid premise with a good cast. But the script has no edge. It plays like a bucolic romantic comedy. Nothing serious happens until the end, when masses of people show up at the general store. They&amp;#39;re all from out of town, hoping to register a local address to get a piece of the pie. The crowd swells. Tempers run short. Someone has a gun. Things start to turn ugly, but Doc arrives in time to settle things down with a hearty speech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what if he didn&amp;#39;t? What if the film started as a comedy but then subverted the genre to show the underside of small town life? A biting satire that &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; explored the effects of sudden wealth on rural America. It might be wrong to criticize the film based on what &lt;em&gt;wasn&amp;#39;t&lt;/em&gt; made, but storytelling is about making decisions. And a decision &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to do something is still a decision.&lt;/p&gt;

Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan (1989) ★★☆☆☆</title><link href='http://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/friday-the-13th-part-viii-jason-takes-manhattan-1989/' /><id>http://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/friday-the-13th-part-viii-jason-takes-manhattan-1989</id><updated>2015-01-07T00:00:00-05:00</updated><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I was about to start high school when this movie came out. I was too young to see it, not that I wanted to. It was the eighth entry in what had become a disregarded franchise. Slasher films were passé.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite all that, I remember this movie&amp;#39;s release. This was well before the internet was a household thing, but that didn&amp;#39;t stop the news from spreading. In a film called &lt;em&gt;Jason Takes Manhattan&lt;/em&gt;, Jason didn&amp;#39;t actually get to New York until the last twenty minutes or so. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The movie opens on Crystal Lake&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. A couple of high school kids are fooling around on a boat. An unfortunate sequence of events sees Jason resurrected from his watery grave via electricity. He makes short work of the two teens, reclaiming his trademark hockey mask in the process&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn2&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast-forward to the following morning. The &lt;em&gt;SS Lazarus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn3&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is about to set sail for New York City, with the local graduating high school class on board. One of the kids, Rennie, is late to arrive. She was reluctant to come, due to a deep fear of the water after almost drowning as a child. Her English teacher, Miss Van Deusen, convinced her. Van Deusen is chaperoning the trip along with Mr. McCulloch, a pompous biology teacher who’s also Rennie’s uncle and legal guardian. McCulloch isn’t happy, but Rennie is determined to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As they set off, Jason sneaks on board and begins picking off the teens. While he goes about his work we’re presented with a series of sub-plots. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rennie has visions of a small boy drowning. Haughty prom queen Tamara tries to blackmail McCulloch by seducing him on video. The captain’s son, Sean, fails to live up to his father’s expectation that he do the nautical equivalent of backing the car out of the garage. Another teen, Julius, shows he’s a hell of a boxer&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn4&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a while, Jason kills the captain. Sean discovers his father’s body and alerts the rest of the passengers. The kids arm themselves and attempt to hunt down Jason. But a series of events causes the ship to sink. Sean, Rennie, Julius, McCulloch and Van Deusen manage to get into a life boat and row to the shores of New York City.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Jason’s right behind them, determined to finish what he started aboard the boat. The finale sees Rennie and Sean running from Jason through a sewer tunnel that’s due to be flushed with toxic waste. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This installment was the lowest grossing entry in the series. But that’s less a reflection on this film and more a confirmation that the previous installment, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/friday-the-13th-part-vii-the-new-blood-1988/&quot;&gt;Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood (1988)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, killed the franchise. &lt;em&gt;That&lt;/em&gt; film was awful. This movie is bad, but nowhere near &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; level of terrible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Granted, much like the previous film, this entry saddles the protagonist with a useless melodramatic sub plot. But the supporting cast here is far more tolerable. And the film doesn’t take itself too seriously. There are a couple of good laughs&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref5&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn5&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yes, the majority of the film does take place on a boat. But if it didn’t have the Manhattan title, I doubt fans would have minded so much. At this point in the series, &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; change of scenery would be welcome. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the most disappointing aspect of this entry is not how long it takes to get to New York. It’s that once it gets there, Jason gets tunnel vision. He doesn’t care about anyone but the people from the boat. He walks through swaths of pedestrians and ignores them. Jason in a major city should be a one-man apocalypse, killing anyone and anything within reach. He does off some street punks, but that&amp;#39;s about it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To that end, &lt;em&gt;Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan&lt;/em&gt; is more disappointing than awful. Aside from a change of scenery, it doesn’t offer anything we haven’t seen done better before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is Crystal Lake an inlet now? The film doesn’t make it clear.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref1&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is ridiculous. One of the kids gets a hockey mask to scare the other, but it happens to be the exact same kind Jason wore. Right down to the chunk missing due to the axe-to-the-face Jason suffered at the end of &lt;em&gt;Friday the 13th Part III (1982)&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref2&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good name.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref3&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because, why wouldn’t a school-sponsored trip to New York City include a little boxing on the way?&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref4&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two scenes made me chuckle. The first was the culmination of the fight between Jason and Julius. The second was when Jason flips up his mask to the street gang after knocking over their boom-box. Good bits.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref5&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood (1988) ★☆☆☆☆</title><link href='http://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/friday-the-13th-part-vii-the-new-blood-1988/' /><id>http://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/friday-the-13th-part-vii-the-new-blood-1988</id><updated>2015-01-05T00:00:00-05:00</updated><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a lesson here. I came to &lt;em&gt;Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood&lt;/em&gt; with an open mind. Sure, I&amp;#39;d heard rumblings that it was bad, but I didn&amp;#39;t read any reviews in advance. I didn&amp;#39;t want to let the masses make up my mind. I&amp;#39;ve seen enough supposedly awful films to know the masses can be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story opens outside a house on Crystal Lake. We see a young girl standing outside the door. Inside, we hear her parents fighting. The mom&amp;#39;s yelling that the dad promised he wouldn&amp;#39;t drink so much. The dad&amp;#39;s telling her to shut up and smacking her around. It aims for drama but plays like caricature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The girl runs down to the lake, walks the length of a short pier, and gets in a small fishing boat. She motors out to the middle of the lake. The dad comes running out of the house down to the pier&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. He yells for her to come back. The mom comes out of the house and joins in the yelling. The dad advances down the pier. The little girl gives the dad the stink-eye of death and the pier starts to shake. Not a rumble, but a full-on cartoonish wobble with the pylons jutting several feet into the air. It&amp;#39;s an expensive-looking mechanical effect, but laughable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pier crumbles down, taking the dad with it. We flash forward to the little girl, now seventeen&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn2&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Her name is Tina. She hasn’t been back to Crystal Lake since that day. She&amp;#39;s returning now, along with her mother, at the coaxing of her smarmy psychiatrist, Dr. Crews. The good doctor says she must confront the death of her father by revisiting the scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tina and her mother arrive at the lake house. Dr. Crews is there waiting. There&amp;#39;s also a house full of teens next door. One of them takes an instant interest in Tina. Perhaps he sees something we don&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few needless scenes later, Tina inadvertently wakes up Jason via her telekinesis&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn3&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Jason sets to work massacring the teens next door&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn4&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Tina’s mom uncovers Dr. Crews’ true intentions. There&amp;#39;s a lot of over emoting and dues ex machina that culminates in a showdown between Tina and Jason. Tina uses her telekinetic powers to hurl flower pots at Jason. There&amp;#39;s a big explosion and a head-scratching ending, then it&amp;#39;s all over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, so the masses were right. This is an awful movie. Sitting through it was a chore. Like the song says, sometimes bad is bad. Lesson learned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But let&amp;#39;s look on the bright side. Zombie Jason looks great. He&amp;#39;s a big hulking monster. This entry also sees Jason make use of power tools&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref5&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn5&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s it for the bright side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This installment attempts to replicate the scenario from &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/friday-the-13th-the-final-chapter-1984/&quot;&gt;Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter (1984)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. A house full of teens next to a house with a single mom and her teenage daughter. Had it just done that, things might not have been so bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it had to tack on a sub-plot involving telekinetic Tina, her mother, and Dr. Crews. This is the worst part of the film. More than once, I ached to fast-forward through these scenes. They aren&amp;#39;t just bad. They&amp;#39;re like a crying baby on an airplane. You just want it to stop. I don’t fault the performers, they&amp;#39;re only working with what they&amp;#39;re given.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, Tina is the worst. Her character is an ineffectual protagonist who spends most of the film in histrionics. The worst kind of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_girl&quot;&gt;final girl&lt;/a&gt;. The film expects us to care about her without giving us a reason for doing so. When the other kids take an instant dislike to her, we’re on their side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And speaking of those kids, they have no chemistry between them. They feel like strangers thrown together rather than friends. None of them register. Their scenes are dull.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this wouldn’t be so bad if the film didn&amp;#39;t take itself so seriously. The black humor in the previous entry is gone. So is the manic campiness that accompanied &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/friday-the-13th-a-new-beginning-1985/&quot;&gt;Friday the 13th: A New Beginning (1985)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Instead we&amp;#39;re asked to suffer through scenes alternating between idle boredom and overwrought melodrama. When Jason offs one of the characters it is a relief. Not because it breaks some nonexistent tension, but because we’re one step closer to the film’s end. In &lt;em&gt;Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood&lt;/em&gt;, it’s the audience, not Jason’s quarry, that suffers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first thought upon seeing the Dad: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Smalley&quot;&gt;Stewart Smalley&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref1&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting this entry in the then-future of 2001. I wonder how many fans realized this back in 1988.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref2&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jason wound up chained to the bottom of Crystal Lake at the end of the previous film. Exactly how Tina’s telekinesis revives him is never explained. As for the telekinesis itself, in his &lt;a href=&quot;http://horror-movie-a-day.blogspot.com/2009/01/friday-13th-part-vii-new-blood.html&quot;&gt;review on Horror Movie A Day&lt;/a&gt;, Brian Collins speculates that it was a response to the higher grossing &lt;em&gt;A Nightmare on Elm Street&lt;/em&gt; franchise. &amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref3&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie should be over right here. Tina resurrects Jason, passing out in the process. Jason marches out of the water and dismembers the unconscious Tina. But no. Jason marches past her and the two houses and goes a couple of miles up the road to off a pair of teens before circling back to continue his rampage. &amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref4&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though, with supernatural strength, one wonders why he bothers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref5&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Jason Lives: Friday the 13th Part VI (1986) ★★☆☆☆</title><link href='http://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/jason-lives-friday-the-13th-part-vi-1986/' /><id>http://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/jason-lives-friday-the-13th-part-vi-1986</id><updated>2015-01-01T00:00:00-05:00</updated><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Jason lives. Not &lt;em&gt;Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives&lt;/em&gt; but &lt;em&gt;Jason Lives: Friday the 13th Part VI&lt;/em&gt;. After the head-scratching mess that was &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/friday-the-13th-a-new-beginning-1985/&quot;&gt;Friday the 13th: A New Beginning (1985)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, somebody in Paramount’s marketing division must have worried that kids would stop reading after the &lt;em&gt;Friday the 13th&lt;/em&gt; part of the title. I’m not sure things were that dire, but it does give you a sense of this film’s mandate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This entry more or less ignores the last film’s events. It opens with Tommy Jarvis determined to rid himself of the specter of Jason. To that end, he plans to dig up Jason’s corpse and incinerate it. He&amp;#39;s even brought a buddy along for help&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tommy and his friend dig up the corpse all right, but a bolt of lightening reanimates the maggot-filled carcass. Undead Jason makes short work of Tommy&amp;#39;s pal, but Tommy manages to escape and attempts to warn the local sheriff. The sheriff, of course, doesn&amp;#39;t believe Tommy and runs him out of town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Jason resumes his murderous ways. He offs some corporate paintballers, and a few teen camp counselors before Tommy gets back to town. Thinking Tommy committed the murders himself, the sheriff locks Tommy up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not to worry though, the sheriff’s plucky teen daughter frees Tommy from his cell. Using a plan Tommy gleaned from reading a book on the occult, the two head to Camp Crystal Lake to stop Jason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This entry cements Jason’s transition from deranged madman to supernatural monster. Jason now has super human strength. Bullets can&amp;#39;t kill him. Early on, Tommy looks to incinerate Jason, but the skies open up and the resulting rain prevents Tommy from striking a match. It’s a nice nod that casts Jason as something of a force of nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This installment also sports a nice streak of self-referential black comedy. Consider the scene where Jason stalks a group of children. One of the boys looks at another and asks sarcastically: “So, what &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; you want to be when you grew up?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, when ever Jason&amp;#39;s on screen this entry&amp;#39;s a lot of fun. Unfortunately, the plot revolves around Tommy. A better script would have killed him off in the film&amp;#39;s opening sequence. Instead, we suffer through a tired &amp;quot;boy who cried wolf&amp;quot; plot that never pays off, and cringe at the stilted melodrama with the sheriff’s daughter.  A stronger performer might have been able to rise above the material. But Thom Mathews’ performance as Tommy kept reminding me of Michael Dudikoff in &lt;em&gt;American Ninja (1985)&lt;/em&gt;. Minus the ninja bad-assery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The focus on Tommy comes at the expense of the supporting cast. Almost all of  Jason&amp;#39;s victim fail to register. The female camp counselors in particular felt interchangeable. They exist only as fodder for Jason and thus, when Jason’s not on screen, they’re boring. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jason Lives: Friday the 13th Part VI&lt;/em&gt; isn’t an awful movie. The depiction of Jason is great, and the fourth-wall humor is a nice touch. But the forced melodrama and bland supporting cast drag things down. The only character we’re interested in is Jason and when he’s off screen, this entry is a snooze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</content></entry><entry><title>17. Friday the 13th: A New Beginning (1985) ★★☆☆☆</title><link href='http://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/friday-the-13th-a-new-beginning-1985/' /><id>http://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/friday-the-13th-a-new-beginning-1985</id><updated>2014-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</updated><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What were they thinking?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That about sums up my reaction to &lt;em&gt;Friday the 13th: A New Beginning&lt;/em&gt;. After nailing the formula in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/friday-the-13th-the-final-chapter-1984/&quot;&gt;Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter (1984)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, they throw everything out the window and nearly kill the franchise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This entry follows Tommy, the young boy who survived the previous film by hacking Jason’s body to pieces with a machete. He&amp;#39;s seventeen now, and in a startling bit of plausibility, has spent the previous six years in a mental institution&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tommy is a lackluster protagonist. He&amp;#39;s superficial to the plot and says less than two-dozen words throughout the film. He spends most of his time either looking confused or violently acting out&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn2&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film opens with Tommy arriving at a kind of halfway house for annoying teens&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn3&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. After one of the kids offs another with an axe, an unseen assailant begins murdering teens, staff, and pretty much everyone on screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harkening back to the original  &lt;em&gt;Friday the 13th (1980)&lt;/em&gt;, this entry is less a monster movie and more of a mystery thriller. But the execution is sloppy. Characters are introduced and killed in the same scene. Several of the performances, such as the backwoods mother and son living adjacent to the halfway house, veer well into camp. Worst of all, the eventual reveal is unsatisfying. It relies on some awkward exposition to explain the killer’s motive and even then makes little sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But time has been kind to &lt;em&gt;Friday the 13th: A New Beginning&lt;/em&gt;. Knowing that the franchise rights itself, fans can appreciate this entry in a so-bad-it’s-good kind of way. The nonsense plot, Tommy’s non-dialog, and the over-the-top performances are all good for a laugh. One of the characters even dies in an outhouse after eating some spicy enchiladas. What were they thinking, indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This puts the film in the then-future of 1990. I had to look this up. The series timeline gets really crazy from here on out as they keep skipping forward in time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref1&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This petulant behavior may be a remnant of an earlier draft of the script. According to the IMDb, Cory Feldman was going to reprise his role as Tommy. But when he was unavailable due to The Goonies (1985), the filmmakers rewrote the part for an older actor. One suspects it was a very quick rewrite.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref2&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not made clear, but one presumes the state is transferring Tommy since he&amp;#39;ll soon age out of the system. But what happened to his sister?&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref3&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
