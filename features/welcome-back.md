  Wherein I declare review bankruptcy and request a second chance.
---

Hey there, constant reader. Frank here.

It looks like I fell off the review wagon, what with my last post coming over a year ago. Sorry about that. See, I enjoy writing about movies, but I enjoy watching them even more. The trouble is that I can't do both at the same time. So the more movies I watched, the more my to-review list grew.

I also spent a lot of time tinkering with this site. My day job is software development, and I love coding almost as much as I love movies. So I went through several design iterations. I added splash images, transitions, and client-side sorting and filtering. The site looked pretty damn sweet. But while I was adding all those features, you know what I wasn't doing? Writing reviews.

Which brings us to today. The top of my to-review list is a movie I saw almost two years ago. And there's over 200 movies after that one.

So I'm declaring review bankruptcy.

What's that mean? Well, in a nutshell, I'm starting over. I've still got the list (over in the [viewing log](/viewings)) of everything I've seen since January 1st 2012, but I'm starting over on reviews.

One of my goals when I started the site was to become a better writer by forcing myself to write more. But writing a review for every movie I watch isn't going to help if the reviews are crap.

And a lot of them were crap.

They were crap because I churned them out to clear the queue. I watch too many movies to review them all. So now, instead of trying to review every movie I watch, I'll aim for one review a week.

That should give me enough time for three drafts per review. Most of the previous reviews were first draft efforts. Three drafts gives a chance to polish while still forcing me to publish the thing instead of tinkering with it for draft after draft.

Finally, to bring the focus back to the writing I redesigned the site again. The splash images and posters are gone, because finding and prepping them took a lot of time. Time better spent writing.

So welcome back, constant reader. I hope you'll give me a second chance. We've got close to a hundred years of cinema to cover and I'm pretty excited.

Let's get started
