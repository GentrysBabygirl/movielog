## The Long Version ##

Grading systems are harder than one would think. It's all about nuance.

Let's start with a binary scale. A yes or no. Gene Siskel based the famous 'Thumbs up/Thumbs down' system on the thought that a person just wants to know: ' Should I see this movie?'[^1].  

It's a pragmatic approach, but how do you separate the good from the great? Put another way, both _Batman Begins_ and _The Dark Knight_ would get a "Thumbs up" but they are not equal.

Enter the star systems. I've seen scales with three stars all the way up to ten, sometimes with half-stars between. 

But not all star-systems are equal. Roger Ebert hated the four-star scale his paper used because it offered no middle ground [^1]. He's right, and we can rule out the four-star system.

Next, let's consider the iMDb. It uses a ten-star system. But in 2009 the median score on the iMBb in 2009 was a 6.6, implying that users are skewing toward the upper bounds. The scale is too large. Defining the nuances between the 10-points is a challenge. Put another way, if a 1-star rating means you hated it, and a 10-star rating means you loved it, what does a 3-star rating mean? 

So if four is too small and ten is too large, what's ideal?

Consider the 5-star systems. Ebert liked it [^1]. It offers a middle ground while still allowing the various ratings to be defined. 

And what about letter grade systems? The Onion AV Club uses them, and I quite like them. They're essentially a five-star system. 5-stars equals an 'A', 4-stars a 'B', 3-stars is a 'C', 2-stars is a 'D', and 1-star is an 'F'. I use a letter grade system behind the scenes because it's how my brain works. 

So why display them as stars? Well, for one, grade definition's aren't universal. When I see a movie with a 'C' grade, I think it was okay, but nothing spectacular. Others may think it was a bad movie. A 3-star out of 5 display makes it clear it's a middle-of-the-road rating.

The other reason is Netflix. With the service's rise in popularity, I decided to synchronize my grades with their review system. Thus, if you've rated movies on Netflix, you'll already be familiar with what my ratings mean. For those that haven't used Netflix, or have forgotten the ratings, here they are with some comments.

![5 stars](5-stars.svg) _I loved it._  
A great movie. A must-see. A perfect or nearly perfect movie. These are the movies I recommend to everyone. This is a hard rating to earn.

![4 stars](4-stars.svg) _I really liked it._  
A really good movie. Unless you hate the genre or star, you should watch it. These are the movies I recommend to most folks. They don't resonate like the 5-star selections, but they don't disappoint either. 

![3 stars](3-stars.svg) _I liked it._  
An okay movie. I wouldn't recommend it, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend _against_ it either. A good rule of thumb: If I liked it but can't remember a line of dialog one-week later, it was just okay. Many a summer blockbuster falls into this category. 

![2 stars](2-stars.svg) _I didn't like it._  
A bad movie. Unless you have a deep seeded love for the genre or star, avoid this. Maybe it had a moment or two of goodness, but it was a disappointment. If I paid money to see it, I felt burned.

![1 star](1-star.svg) _I hated it._  
An awful movie. Not even in the 'so-bad-it's-good' sense. Everyone involved should apologize. This too is a hard rating to earn. When reading a 1-star review, remember: I watch them so you don't have to.
