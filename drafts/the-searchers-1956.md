Synopsis: A bitter civil war veteran spends seven years searching for his niece, abducted by Indians.

The Searchers is an amazing film. John Wayne turns in the performance of his career with a nuanced portrayal of a man torn apart by war. As the film progresses, we see just how damaged Wayne's character really is, as his hatred begins to consume him.

Director John Ford frames the descent exquisitely, right up to the famous closing shot, perfectly illustrating how Wayne's character's obsession has left him utterly alone.

The film's only weak spot is a soft middle that attempts to inject some ill-conceived comic relief with the supporting cast. This is really nit-picking though, as The Searchers is one of the greats.

Finally, there's been talk of The Searchers being an anachronism, a politically incorrect film that promotes racism. But this couldn't be further from the truth. The Searchers is still relevant today as a cautionary tale about how war breeds hate: just swap Arabs for the Indians, and the Middle East for Monument Valley. It's this relevance, over fifty years later that illustrates why The Searchers is so good.

Bottom Line: Highly recommended.
