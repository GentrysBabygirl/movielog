The Searchers is a dark drama about the insideous nature of racism. Set a few years after the Civil War, John Wayne plays Ethan Edwards, a former Confederate solider. Ethan visits his brother's family on the Texas frontier. Shortly after arriving, Ethan's brother and sister-in-law are massacred by Comanche. After the funeral, Ethan sets off in search of his two young nieces, who the Comanche have taken captive. Accompanying Ethan is Martin Pawley, a young man Ethan's brother's family took in when he was just an orphan child. (pronoun trouble)

Years pass. The trail goes cold. The pair catch a break. The trail goes cold again. Over time, Martin realizes Ethan means to kill the girls should they find them, such is Ethan's unbridled hate for the Comanche.





Synopsis: A bitter civil war veteran spends seven years searching for his niece, abducted by Indians.

The Searchers is an amazing film. John Wayne turns in the performance of his career with a nuanced portrayal of a man torn apart by war. As the film progresses, we see just how damaged Wayne's character really is, as his hatred begins to consume him.

Director John Ford frames the descent exquisitely, right up to the famous closing shot, perfectly illustrating how Wayne's character's obsession has left him utterly alone.

The film's only weak spot is a soft middle that attempts to inject some ill-conceived comic relief with the supporting cast. This is really nit-picking though, as The Searchers is one of the greats.

Finally, there's been talk of The Searchers being an anachronism, a politically incorrect film that promotes racism. But this couldn't be further from the truth. The Searchers is still relevant today as a cautionary tale about how war breeds hate: just swap Arabs for the Indians, and the Middle East for Monument Valley. It's this relevance, over fifty years later that illustrates why The Searchers is so good.

Bottom Line: Highly recommended.
