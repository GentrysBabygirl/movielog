_Dangerous Mission_ opens with a murder. We see a man playing a piano in a deserted club. A man approaches. There's a gunshot and we hear a woman scream. 

Next we're in a posh high-rise office. A man sits smoking a cigarette in a chair with his back to us. Other men pace around him. There was a witness, they say. The DA thinks he can make the case stick. The man needs to take care of it. 

Next we're outside Montana's Glacier National Park. ? played by Victor Mature checks in at the gate. After he pulls away, the guard, seemingly alarmed radios up to the park ranger, played by William Bendix.



Synopsis: After witnessing a mob hit, a woman flees to Montana’s Glacier Park, where she meets a photographer (Vincent Price) and an ex-marine (Victor Mature).

Dangerous Mission is somewhat similar to <a href= "/browse/reviews/the-las-vegas-story-1952/">The Las Vegas Story</a>.  Both feature Victor Mature and Vincent Price and both are showcases for their respective locales.

Unfortunately, Dangerous Mission fails to make the most of Price, who once again is the film’s strongest asset. He’s neither charming nor menacing, and top-billed Victor Mature’s one-note performance is a total write-off.

Sure, the Technicolor photography of the Glacier Park locales is nice, but director Louis King’s decision to film the finale on a sound stage (which probably came down to money) is a real downer.

Fortunately, there are quite a few unintentionally funny moments, such as Price’s cowboy outfit, or his kick to Victor Mature’s head, which make for campy fun, and the brief 75-minute running time means it’s all over pretty quick.

Bottom Line: As a so-bad-it’s-good entry Dangerous Mission might be a winner, but taken straight, it’s pretty forgettable.
