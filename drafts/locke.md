_Locke_ is not a great film, but it is a good one. If you're on the fence about seeing it, do so. Don't read any further, as we're going to talk about plot and this movie works best the less you know going in.

Still here? Okay, here we go.

_Locke_ opens with the a wide shot of a construction site. It's dark, but spotlights illuminate the massive foundation hole. Early the next morning, they will pour the concrete. It will be the largest commercial pour in Europe. Ivan Locke (Tom Hardy) is the construction manager in charge.

The film opens with Ivan getting into his car. He pulls away from the curb and makes a call. He gets a woman's voicemail. He tells her he's gotten her message and that he's on his way.

As the film unfolds we learn that Ivan travelling to London from Birmingham. We also learn that circumstances surrounding the trip. Last year he had a one night stand while away on a job. The first and only time he's strayed in ? years of marriage. But the woman, Bethan, became pregnant. Now, the baby has come early and she's gone into labor.

The rest of the film happens in near real-time, as Ivan juggles a series of calls. He is a methodical man. The kind of man who makes checklists. The kind of man who is both dilligent and pragmatic. He has fathered a child. Now he must accept that responsibility and do right by that child. A deep-rooted pyschological need drives him. Ivan's father abandoned him as a child, and he will not do the same.

As the film unfolds, Ivan loses his job, his family and his home. He accepts this with a calm detachment. These are the consequences of his actions. He compartmentalizes them. He must be there for his child. Perhaps the most telling scene comes early, when Bethan asks if he loves her. "How can I?", Ivan asks, "I don't know you." His tone is not cruel. It is the voice of a man trying to convince her of the truth he needs to believe.

It's a riviting emotional journey. But then, just as abruptly as it began, it's over. Ivan's world has changed and he heads off to what will be, for him, a new life. I didn't like this ending, but I'm not sure how I would change it. It felt anti-climatic. Not enough to ruin the film, but enough that it undercut the emotional arc.
