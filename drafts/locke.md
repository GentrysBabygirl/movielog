If you're on the fence about seeing _Locke_, see it. Don't read any further, as we're going to talk about plot and I think this movie is better the less you know going in.

Still here? Okay, here we go.

_Locke_ opens with the a wide shot of a building under construction. It's dark. Early the next morning, they will pour the concrete foundation. It will be the largest commercial pour in Europe. Ivan Locke (Tom Hardy) is the construction manager in charge.

The film opens with Ivan getting into his car. He pulls away from the curb and makes a call. He gets a woman's voicemail. He tells her he's gotten her message and that he's on his way.

As the film unfolds we learn that Ivan is on his way down to London from Birmingham. It seems last year he had a one night stand while away on a job, and the woman, Bethan, became pregnant. The baby has come early and she's gone into labor.

As he drives, Ivan juggles a series of calls.

He calls his boss to say he won't be there for the pour in the morning. The boss is furious. Bethan calls to ask him when he'll be there. Ivan says he's coming as fast as he can. She asks if he loves her. How can he, he says, he doesn't know her. Ivan calls his wife to confess to the affair. She hangs up on him. His son, unaware, calls to ask if he's watching the football match.

In the midst of this emotional chaos, Ivan calls one of his underlings to ensure the pour goes off without a problem.

Ivan resolves to be there for the child. His father was never there for him.  even at the expense of his job, his marriage, and his family.

The rest of the film happens in the car.
