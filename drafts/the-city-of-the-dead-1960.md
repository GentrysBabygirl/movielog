Synopsis: At the behest of her professor (Christopher Lee), a graduate student travels to a small New England town to research witchcraft.

The City of the Dead (Horror Hotel in the USA), is an effective thriller that makes the most of its modest budget.  This is due, in large part, to some great casting.  Christopher Lee has a limited, but very effective, role that helps to get the ball rolling (listen closely during his first scene for the “Superstition, fear, and jealousy.” sample lifted for Rob Zombie’s song “Dragula.”), as does Valentine Dyall whose especially powerful performance still seems creepy today.

Adding to this is a script that, at a brisk 76 minutes, never idles and eschews some of the usual plot trappings.  Granted, the ending seems a little <em>too</em> easy, but it’s still well done.

The City of the Dead’s only real misstep is in its overzealous use of dry ice.  While subtle use can enhance the atmosphere, the director’s decision to give the entire town a perpetual knee-high fog makes only serves to make it look like exactly what it is: something out of a low-budget horror movie.

Bottom Line: A good horror film buoyed by good performances instead of special effects.  Fans of Christopher Lee and the genre should make this a must-see.  Recommended.
