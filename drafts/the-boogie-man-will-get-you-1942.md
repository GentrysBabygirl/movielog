Young divorcee Winnie wants to open an inn. She thinks she's found the perfect spot in the crumbing home of  Professor Billings (Boris Karloff). 

Billings is willing to sell, under the condition that he stay on to finish his experiments in his basement laboratory. Winnie agrees.

Of course, she doesn't know that Billings' work involves trying to create an army of atomic supermen to win the war. Or that his test subjects consist of the various traveling salesmen that show up at his door. Or that all his experiments have been fatal failures, leaving him with a small morgue full of corpses. One would think that would have come up in the walk-through.

Just as Winnie completes the deal, her condescending ex-husband, Bill, shows up. Bill thinks Billings is scamming Winnie and decides to stick around to prove it. 

Bill pokes around and comes across one of the traveling salesman's corpses. He alerts the town sheriff, Dr. Lorentz (Peter Lorre). Lorentz is also the town doctor, town notary, town councilman, and town treasurer. He carries a cat in his pocket. Lorre has fun with the role. Anyway, an outraged Lorentz confronts Billings. But Billings explains his project and Lorentz sees a potential for big profits. The two become partners. 

Except now they're short on test subjects. The two turn their attention to Bill before traveling powder-puff salesmen Maxie shows up. But before they can begin testing on Maxie, one of the inn's other guests turns up murdered. Thing wrap up via an escaped fascist looking to blow up the nearby munitions depot. Because, you know, what better spot to open an inn then next to a munitions depot.

Despite the mad-scientist and murder-mystery elements, the film plays as a gentle comedy. Karloff comes across as more of a doting Professor than a mad-scientist. His scenes with Lorre are funny, particularly the bits with them bemoaning that lack of quality test subjects. 

The love story between Winnie and Bill falls flat, though. It drags down what's otherwise an entertaining knock off of _Arsenic and Old Lace (1944)_.
