_The Long Night_ is perhaps too long. The third act undoes what's otherwise a competant little melodrama. But, like the film, I'm starting at the end. The film opens with a murder. We're outside an apartment in on the working-class side of the tracks. We hear gunshots and see a man fall backwards, of of one of the units down the stairs. The police arrive. They attempt to extract the shooter, who says he wants to be left alone. Hearing the shooter's voice, we recognize him to be Henry Fonda. 

Through flashbacks, we learn that Henry Fonda plays Joe, a veteran recently returned from World War II. He's an aimalbe guy. The kind of guy who uses phrases like ?. 

One day, while working at the power wash plant, Joe meets a young girl named ?, played by Barbara Bel Geddes. Joe and ? hit it off. They're both orphans. They begin dating. Joe falls pretty hard.

One night, ? cancells a date with Joe. She has something to do. Joe says that's fine, but takes ?'s favorite stuffed animal hostage, as a bit of insurance that she'll see him again. It's a nice touch that gives Joe a bit of edge and helps make the film's later events more plausible.

Joe ends up tailing ? to a dingy bar. There's a magician performaning. 



Synopsis: A veteran (Henry Fonda) rivals a stage magician (Vincent Price) for the affections of a girl (Barbara Bel Geddes).

The Long Night is just that. It's long. With an hour's worth of plot stretched into 101-minutes, this is a tired melodrama masquerading as a film noir that wastes the talents of its leads.

Henry Fonda is good as a frustrated veteran in a performance that evolves into a variation of his turn as Tom Joad in <a href="/browse/reviews/the-grapes-of-wrath-1940/">The Grapes of Wrath (1940)</a>, Barbara Bel Geddes is a bit cloying at times in this, her film debut, but she's passable, and Vincent Price steals the picture as an egotistical stage magician.

Sol Polito's cinematography is nice and goes along way toward giving the film its film-noir connotations, but the script lacks any real edge and director Anatole Litvak lets things drag on far too long. How many shots do we need of Bel Geddes fighting her way through the crowd in the finale? And really, that part where she gets knocked out by a bicycle? That's just silly.

That said, if you're a big Vincent Price fan, you might want to give The Long Night a look, as he really does steal the show, but everyone else can, and should, skip it.
