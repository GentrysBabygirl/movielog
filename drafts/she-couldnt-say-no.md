Sometimes a movie lets you down. Often this is because the movie was bad and you payed money thinking it would be good. But sometimes the movie is just okay when it could have been better. Such is the case with _She Couldn't Say No_.

The story follows an oil heiress named Korby Lane, played by Jean Simmons. Korby travels to the small, rural town of Progress, Arkansas. Once there, she assumes the name of Korby Johnson and begins anonymously doling out large sums of money to the townsfolk.

She also takes an interest in Doc Sellers, played by Robert Mitchum. Doc susses out Korby's motivations, and tries to dissuade her. But Korby is stubborn. Her generosity backfires. The town vet ups and leaves town, leaving the local farmers in a lurch. So does the owner of the boarding house where Korby's been staying. The town drunk, played by the always charming Arthur Hunnicutt, almost dies of alcohol poisioning.

As the town decends into chaos, Korby realizes the error of her ways. She comes clean as the town's beneficiary and says there'll be no more money. Korby and Doc get together and we're led to believe the town is more-or-less back to normal. Of course, we know that can't be true, but this is part of how the film lets us down.

It's a film built on a solid premise with a good cast. But the script has no edge. It plays like a light bucolic romantic comedy. Nothing serious happens until the end, when masses of people show up, hoping to get a piece of the pie. Things start to turn ugly, but Doc arrives in time to settle things down with a hearty speech.

But what if he didn't? What if the film started as a comedy but then subverted the genre to show the underside of small town life? A biting satire that _really_ explored the effects of sudden wealth on rural America. It might be wrong to criticize the film based on what _wasn't_ made, but storytelling is about making decisions. And a decision to _not_ do something is still a decision.
_She Couldn't Say No_ isn't a bad movie. Just one that had the potential to rise above mediocre status. Instead, the title is the most exciting thing about it. Still, the performers are more than capable of holding our interest. Just don't be surprised if you're left wondering what could have been.
