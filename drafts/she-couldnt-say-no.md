_She Couldn't Say No_ follows Korby Lane (Jean Simmons), an oil heiress, who travels tot he small town of Progress, Arkansas. Once there, she assumes the name of Korby Johnson and begins anonymously doling out large sums of money to the townsfolk. 

She also takes an interest in Doc Sellers, played by Robert Mitchum. Doc susses out Korby's motivations, and tries to dissuade her. Korby is stubborn. Her generosity backfires, destroying the town. 

Of course, it all (kind of) works out in the end, and Korby and Doc end up together.

_She Couldn't Say No_ is a good title, just not for this movie. It's baiting, but this isn't that kind of movie. That said, this could have been better. It's a solid premise, and the cast is more than up to the dramatic challenge, but the script has no edge. In the hands of someone like Billy Wilder this could have been amazing. Imagine the biting satire that could come from _really_ exploring the effect of sudden wealth on a small southern town. This film hints at it, especially toward the end when masses of people show up from out of town, hoping to get a piece of the pie, and things start to turn ugly. But Doc arrives in time to settle things down. But what if he didn't. What if it started as a straightforward bucolic romantic comedy but then subverted the genre to show the underside of small town life? 

But we'll never know. As is, _She Couldn't Say No_ isn't an embarrasment. The performers are more than capable, and script is engaging enough to hold our interest. Just don't be surprised if you're left wondering what could have been.
