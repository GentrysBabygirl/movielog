Eden travels to Lee's remote country estate in search of his missing brother. There he encounters a hippy orgy, a professor of the occult (Karloff), and the legend of Lavinia Morley, a witch killed 300 years prior. Lots of atmosphere, some over-the-top dream sequences replete with gratuitous nudity, and the always-solid Lee make this a guilty pleasure, especially with the gorgeous high-definition transfer.
