Synopsis: During World War II, a small group of American soldiers (Steve McQueen, Bobby Darin, Harry Guardino and James Coburn) is ordered to hold a position against an overwhelming number of Germans.

Hell Is for Heroes is a solid little war picture thanks to its great cast, gritty direction and tight script. 

Steve McQueen, looking more than a bit like James Cagney, is great, playing a mentally scarred loner that echoes his performance in <a href="/browse/reviews/the-war-lover-1962/">The War Lover (1962)</a>. His commanding presence demands attention despite minimal dialog, and he absolutely nails the character of a man you'd be hard pressed to like, yet would love to have next to you in a foxhole. 

Supporting McQueen is a great cast including a young James Coburn, Bobby Darin, Fess Parker and Harry Guardino. Look fast for a young L.Q. Jones. All the men shine in their roles and, indeed, the cast is near perfect, with two exceptions. Nick Adams overdoes his part as a Polish refugee, and Bob Newhart is simply out of place doing a variation of his standup shtick in what's otherwise a realistic picture.

Those missteps aside, Hell Is for Heroes is a good movie. McQueen is in top form, and director Don Siegel does a great job of building atmosphere. For fans of the genre, it's a no-brainer, but even those not normally inclined toward war pictures may want to give this one a shot. It's not perfect, but it's definitely worth a look.
