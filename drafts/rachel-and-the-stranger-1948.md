William Holden plays David Harvey, a pioneer farmer living with his young son Davey. David's wife Susan died the previous year, sinking him into a depression. It's only after finding Davey using a page from one of this school books as  a sail for a toy boat, that David resolves to find a new wife. Not for love, but because he knew how important it was to Susan that Davey not grow up "woodsy".

Holden travels to the nearby stockade and consults the Parson. The Parson, in turn, suggests David buy the contract of a bond woman named Rachael. David likes the idea of a servant. A woman but not a wife.

But the Parson says, "Decent church folk don't live together man and woman under the same roof without marriage." So David marries Rachael and takes her back to his farm.

Though he is distant, David is not cruel to her. She sleeps in the bed, David sleeps in another room on the floor. Rachael is timid, but works to endear herself. David takes no notice.

Davey, however, is downright cruel. When she tells him she was brought there to give him his schooling and sort of mother him, Davey spits back, "The devil it was! You're a bond slave is all!"

Thing change when Jim, a family friend played by Robert Mitchum, arrives. Jim's a hunter and tracker. He was a one time suitor of the now-deceased Susan, and both he and David were suprised she chose David over him. Jim, it seems has decided to settle down, and takes an instant interest in Rachel.

Jim is attentive and charming. David gets jealous. Both men begin to vie for Rache's attention, culminating in a fist-fight that in turn leads to Rachel leaving them both. There's an obligatory Indian attack, then it's over.

Lets start with the good. The three leads are solid. Loretta Young is good as the mousey Rachel. Holden is good as the pioneer farmer. Holden is always good in period pictures. Something about his face and demeanor fits, and would only get better as the actor aged. Michum is great as a laconic woodsman. Almost _too_ good. More than any other character, you like him from the start. Why wouldn't Rachel want to go off with him and start a life?

But, despite the talented leads, this is not a good movie. It takes its audience for simpletons, incapable of picking up any subtlety. 

Consider when, after arriving in the cabin, Rachael is clearing the table. David and Davey are talking. Davey says he won't get an music lessons. We see Rachael pause. This should have been it. Cut, next scene. Instead, the film cuts to a close-up of Rachael. We see her look off screen, open her mouth to say something, then close it and look down at Davey. Davey looks back, daring her to talk. She doesn't and walks away. It's a ten second scene that should have been one. We got it the first time, Rachael can play but she doesn't want to make waves.

It script is clumsy too. Consider when David and Davey are out working when they hear a turkey. Davey whines abut wanting to go take a shot at the bird. David grabs Davey and dives to the ground. The turkey call is the signal of Shawnee Indians. Of course, it's just Jim, but when he steps out of the woods to greet David he tells them there's signs of Shawnee up to the north. We haven't heard a thing about Indians up to this point, but now the script mentions Shawnee four times. There isn't a mention of them again until they attack in the finale. This scene, like the Indian attack itself, feel tacked-on and forced.

But that's how much of this film works. Characters don't act organically, they act _conveniently_. Rachael is a reserved mouse until Jim and David get into a fight, then she announces she's leaving. Davey spends most of the film spitting venom at Rachael, but after she makes him a meal one night, he's happy to have her as his mother.

And speaking of Davey, he's an awful character. He's whiny and obstinate. We're given no reason to like him. Yes, he misses his mother. But the way he's presented, one suspects he was annoying long before Susan departed this earth.

There's a kernel of a good story here, and the three leads are more than capable of pulling it off. But the melodramatic fable they're given to work with is frustrating at best, and annoying at worst. The adult themes of intimacy and emotional neglect belie a trite narrative that's presented in a condescending manner.
