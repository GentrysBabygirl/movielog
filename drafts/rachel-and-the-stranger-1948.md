Synopsis: A frontier farmer (William Holden) treats his new wife (Loretta Young) like a servant until a visiting family friend (Robert Mitchum) shows interest.

Rachel and the Stranger is a mostly well-cast western melodrama highlighted by a surprisingly good performance from William Holden.

Holden is perfect as a pioneer farmer. His inflection with the dialog makes it feel natural rather than forced and he innately looks the part, his looks neither too rugged nor to soft to pass for a farmer on the dangerous American frontier. It's a surprising casting coup, and one that almost makes you wish Holden played more period roles.

Opposite Holden, Loretta Young seems equally at home playing the frontier wife. Her reserved demeanor and naturally sad eyes suit the role well. For his part, Mitchum may not take to the era as readily as Holden or Young, but his laconic charm and easy demeanor more than make up for it.

The weak casting link is Gary Gray as Holden's character's son. He's whiny and annoying and fails to cultivate any sympathy from the audience. 

The script by Waldo Salt does a good job through most of the film, but tacks on a very forced plot twist at the end (what exactly did Young's character hope to accomplish by riding back?) which, compounded with Gray's bratty character ultimately makes Rachel and the Stranger just an okay movie instead of a very good one.
