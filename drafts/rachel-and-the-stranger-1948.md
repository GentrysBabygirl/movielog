_Rachel and the Stranger_ is an often frustrating film buyed held together by the strength of its three leads.

William Holden plays David Harvey, a pioneer farmer living with his young son Davey. David's wife Susan died the previous year, sinking him into a depression. When he finds a page of one of Davey's schoolbooks being used as a sail for a toy boat, David resolves to find a new wife. Not for love, but because he knew how important it was to Susan that Davey not grow up "woodsey".

Holden travels to the nearby stockade and consults the Parson. The Parson, in turn, suggests David buy the contract of a bond woman named Rachael. David likes the idea of a servant, but the Parson pushes marraiage. "Decent church folk don't live together man and woman under the same roof without marriage."

So David marries Rachael and takes her back to his farm. He is distant but not cruel to her. She sleeps in the bed, David sleeps in another room on the floor. Rachael is timid, but works to endear herself. David takes no notice.

Davey, however is downright cruel. When she tells him she's there to give him his schooling and sort of mother him, Davey spits back, "The devil it was! You're a bond slave is all!"

Thing change when Jim, a family friend played by Robert Mitchum, arrives. Jim's a hunter and tracker. He was a one time suitor of the now-deceased Susan, and both he and David were suprised she chose David over him. Jim, it seems has decided to settle down, and takes an instant interest in Rachel.

Jim is attentive and charming. David gets jealous. Both men begin to vie for Rache's attention, culminating in a fist-fight that in turn leads to Rachel leaving them both. There's an obligatory Indian attack at the end.

Despite the talented leads, this is not a good movie. It takes its audience for simpletons, incapable of picking up any subtlety. After arriving in the cabin, Rachael is clearing the table. David and Davey talking. Davey says he won't get an music lessons. We see Rachael pause. This should have been it. Cut, next scene. Instead, the film cuts to a close-up of Rachael, we see her look off screen, open her mouth to say something, then close it and look down at Davey. Davey looks back, darking her to say something. She doesn't and walks away. It's a ten second scene that should have been one. We got it the first time, Rachael can play but she doesn't want to make waves. 

Later, when David and Davey are out working when they hear a turkey. Davey whines aobut wanting to go take a shot at the bird. David grabs Davey and dives to the ground. The turkey call is the signal of Shawnee Indians. Of course, it's just Jim, but when he steps out of the woods to greet David he tells them there's signs of Shawnee up to the north. In about two minutes the script mentions Shawnee four times. We get it, they're going to attack. Of course, everyone is unconcerned until the last act.

But that's how this film works. Characters don't act organically, but rather conveniently. Davey spends most of the film spitting venom at Rachael, but after she makes him a meal one night he's happy to have her as his mother. Rachael is a reserved mouse until Jim and David get into a fight, then she announces she's leaving. 

There's a kernel of a good story here, and the three leads are more than capable of pulling it off. But the melodramatic fable they're given to work with is frustrating at best, and annoying at worst. The character of Davey gets the worst of it. We're given no reason to like him. He's whiney and obstinate. Yes, he misses his mother. But the way he's presented, one gets the feeling that he was annoying long before Susan departed this earth.

Holden is good as a pioneer farmer.

Michum is great as the laconic woodsman. 

Loretta Young is good as the mousey Rachael.

The film is content to tell a simple story, but it's a trite one. 


Synopsis: A frontier farmer (William Holden) treats his new wife (Loretta Young) like a servant until a visiting family friend (Robert Mitchum) shows interest.

Rachel and the Stranger is a mostly well-cast western melodrama highlighted by a surprisingly good performance from William Holden.

Holden is perfect as a pioneer farmer. His inflection with the dialog makes it feel natural rather than forced and he innately looks the part, his looks neither too rugged nor to soft to pass for a farmer on the dangerous American frontier. It's a surprising casting coup, and one that almost makes you wish Holden played more period roles.

Opposite Holden, Loretta Young seems equally at home playing the frontier wife. Her reserved demeanor and naturally sad eyes suit the role well. For his part, Mitchum may not take to the era as readily as Holden or Young, but his laconic charm and easy demeanor more than make up for it.

The weak casting link is Gary Gray as Holden's character's son. He's whiny and annoying and fails to cultivate any sympathy from the audience. 

The script by Waldo Salt does a good job through most of the film, but tacks on a very forced plot twist at the end (what exactly did Young's character hope to accomplish by riding back?) which, compounded with Gray's bratty character ultimately makes Rachel and the Stranger just an okay movie instead of a very good one.
