_Blue Ruin_ follows Dwight, a homeless man living on the Delaware coast. When we first meet him, he is hurrying out of a house he’d broken into, as the owners have arrived. He hasn’t broken in to steal, just to take a bath. It’s an elegant way of showing us that Dwight is homeless by choice. 

One morning Dwight is roused by one of the local cops, who take Dwight into the station. He isn’t in any trouble, but they have news and wanted him to be in a safe place when he heard it. The man who killed Dwight’s mother and father is getting paroled early.

Dwight takes the news with an eerie calm. He returns to the rusty car he sleeps in, replaces the battery, fills up the tank and heads home. Home is a small town in the mountains of Virginia. 

Dwight has come home for vengeance. He travels to the prison. He arrives in time to see the man who murdered his parents walk free. He sees the man’s family arrive in a white limousine to greet him (pronoun issue). He follows the limo to a nearby dive bar. He sneaks in through the back door and waits in the mens room. Eventually, his target enters and Dwight exacts his revenge. He’d wanted a gun, but all he could afford was a small shiv. It’s a brutal, clumsy bit of violence. Dwight sneaks back out of the bar and pops the limo’s tire with his shiv. In the process, he slashes his hand. It doesn’t matter though because he’s done it. He returns to his car and reaches for his keys…

They’re not there. He’d lost them in the fight. It’s a plot point that could easily feel predictable or forced, but here, like so much of the movie, it feels _inevitable_. Dwight steals the limo and makes his escape, flat tire and all, but he knows its just a matter of time before they trace his car.

Which brings Dwight to his estranged sister. Their meeting communicates volumes about Dwight’s state of mind simply by showcasing the contrasting ways in which they’ve adjusted to the death of their parents. Dwight disappeared, opting to drop out of society rather than face his grief. His sister has moved on. 

During the course of their meeting, Dwight discovers that his actions haven’t made the news. He soon realizes that this means they weren’t reported. Dwight and his sister rush back to her home to check on her kids. They’re safe, but Dwight realizes it’s only a matter of time before <>’s family traces the car to his sister’s house, where it’s registered. He convinces her to take her family and go, then waits for the inevitable.

_Blue Ruin_ is a straightforward rural noir. There aren’t any flashbacks or quirky characters. There are no cinematic allusions or pop-culture references. It’s a simple story told well.

Well, almost. Fair warning, I’m about to nitpick what’s otherwise a great film, and in the process, spoil a couple of plot points. If you haven’t seen the film, I encourage you to give it a look, then come back and read the rest of this review.

Still here? Okay, here goes: there are two marks on an otherwise spotless report card. 

The first is when Ben takes Dwight back to his isolated cabin. Dwight asks Ben if he’s a hunter, and Dwight replies that he isn’t, and that he mostly does target shooting. At this point we know that Ben is going to snipe the guy in Dwight’s car. If a gun is introduces in act 1 it must go off by act 3. The film’s biggest strength is that the story feels organic. Every plot point has you thinking _Of course, that would happen_. Ben’s saving Dwight is the first, and only, thing that feels cinematic and predictable as opposed to inevitable. 

The second mark is a bit more problematic, as it concerns a plot point the entire movie is based on. It seems Dwight’s parents were killed because his father fell in love with the wife of the father of the man Dwight killed. Now, when you’re watching the movie this seems plausible enough, but in retrospect it doesn’t hold up. We’ve seen the <> family. We’ve seen the children. They’re gun-crazy and borderline hill-billy. Contrast them with the meek Dwight and his equally meek sister. How does a man who raised such a meek family, a family that has Dwight not even knowing how to shoot a gun, attract and pursue the kind of woman who would be attracted to and marry the backwoods, gun-crazy <>?  The characters tell us it happened, but the movie gives us nothing to support it. 

Even with these flaws, _Blue Ruin_ is an exceptionally well-done movie. There are no explosions, no car chases, and the only gunfight happens off-screen. How refreshing.
