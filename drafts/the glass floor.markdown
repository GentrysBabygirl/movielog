Stephen King's "The Glass Floor" tells the story of Charles Wharton's investigation into the death of his sister, Janine, and her husband Reynard's unusual refusal to let Wharton see where the death occurred. 

King uses the story to explore the disorienting effect of mirrors, and while his finale set piece is good, everything leading up to it feels forced and drawn-out. 

King goes to great lengths to build atmosphere (even resorting to the dreaded adverb--the housekeeper was _hideously_ old, her hand was _grotesquely_ twisted) but does little to invest the reader in the story. Janine is little more than a name and Wharton's relationship with her is a mystery. What was she like? Were they close? Did they have a falling out over her marriage to Reynard? Fleshing out some of these details would go a long way toward making the reader interested in _Janine_ and, in turn, as curious as Wharton about the circumstances surrounding her death.
