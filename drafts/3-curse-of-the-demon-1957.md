Andrews is a skeptical psychologist determined to expose a cult of devil-worshippers (led by MacGinnis, in a stand-out performance) as frauds in this near-classic thriller, marred only by producer Hal Chester's short-sighted insertion of cheap effects shots showing the monster. Turner, Bennett and Andrews all fought him on it, but lost. Damn shame.
