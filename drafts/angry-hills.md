_The Angry Hills_ starts well enough. It's 1941. Robert Mitchum plays Mike Morrison, an American Correspondent whose just arrived in Greece. The Nazis are preparing to take the country and Mike plans to be on the next plane out. Before he can go, a Greek patriot slips him a list of Greek Nazi collaborators and urges him to get it to British Intelligence. Mike doesn't want to get involved, but Gustapo agents force him to flee through the darkened back streets of Athens. Mike narrowly escapes by hitching a ride on a British convoy.

Then things start to fall apart. The film jumps ahead. We learn the the Germans bombed the British Convoy. That Mike survived thanks to some fisherman who took him to a remote villiage. _Then_ the film jumps back and we see the convoy get bombed. Then we're back with Mike in a small Greek villiage.

Things fizzle out here. A young, hotheaded female villiager named Eleftheria nurses Mike back to health. Mike then leads the villigers on a raid of a Nazi supply depot. The raid goes bad. The Nazi's slaughter all the the men save Mike and another, who manage to get away. They can't understand what happened. Never mind that, just before the raid a British soldier showed up, said he'd like to help them, learned all the details about the raid, then left. Gee, think it might have been him?

Anyway, the Nazi's massacre the villiage trying to find Mike and the list. He and Eleftheria travel to a convent where Mike's given passage back to Athens. Once there, things get a little better.

Lisa, a widowed British spy, is Mike's contact. But the Gestapo gets wind of Mike's escape and threatens Lisa's children if she doesn't turn Mike over. She sets him up, but changes her mind at the last minute. To rescue her children, she makes a deal with a local underworld figure named Chesney. Chesney, played as a Sidney Greenstreet clone by Sebastian Cabot, double crosses the local Nazi agents while Lisa distracts the chief officer.

The film looks good, especially when it's in Athens. The location filming, and rich use of shadows give it a great sense of atmosphere. The cast is solid too. Mitchum is great as a reluctant hero, and Stanley Baker is a surprisingly multi-dimensional villian. 

But it's so uneven. The first and third acts plays like a spy-thriller. This is where the film works best. The middle, with Mike regulated to the village, is dull and visually uninspired. 

Given that there's enough good here to make you think of what they could have done, this is a disappointment.
