_The Angry Hills_ could have been spliced together from three different movies.

_The Angry Hills_ starts well enough. It's 1941. Robert Mitchum plays Mike Morrison, an American Correspondent who has just arrived in Greece. The Nazis are preparing to take the country and Mike plans to be on the next plane out. Before he can go, a man presents him with a list of Nazi collaborators. The man urges Mike to get the list to British Intelligence. Mike brushes the man off, he doesn't want to get involved. Later, while out with a friend, Mike discovers the list in his jacket.  Mike attempts to unload the list to another Greek reistance fighter, but Gestapo agents are already on Mike's tail. They force him to flee through the darkened back streets of Athens. Mike narrowly escapes by hitching a ride on a British convoy.

So far, so good. Mitchum is great as a reluctant hero. The cinematography is sharp and the Athens locales provide great atmosphere. 

But then the movie throws all this aside and devolves into something else. It jumps ahead. We learn the the Germans bombed the British Convoy. That Mike survived thanks to some fisherman who took him to a remote villiage. _Then_ the film jumps back and we see the convoy get bombed. Then we're back with Mike in a small Greek villiage.

The village scenes are dull and visually uninspiring. The tone shifts from thriller to melodrama, as a young, hotheaded female villiager named Eleftheria nurses Mike back to health. 

Then things just get rediculous. Mike then leads the villigers on a raid of a Nazi supply depot. The raid goes bad. The Nazi's slaughter all the the men save Mike and another, who manage to get away. They can't understand what happened. Never mind that, just before the raid a British soldier showed up, said he'd like to help them, learned all the details about the raid, then left. 

Anyway, the Nazi's massacre the villiage trying to find Mike and the list. He and Eleftheria travel to a convent where Mike's given passage back to Athens. Once there, things get a little better, as the film shifts back into espionage thriller.

Lisa, a widowed British spy, is Mike's contact. The Gestapo gets wind of this and kidnap Lisa's children. She's to turn over Mike if she wants to see her kids again. She sets Mike up, but changes her mind at the last minute. To rescue her children, she makes a deal with a local underworld figure named Chesney. Chesney, played as a Sidney Greenstreet clone by Sebastian Cabot, double crosses the local Nazi agents while Lisa distracts the chief officer. It's a satisfactory ending, but one in which Mike is superfluous. By this point the list is all but forgetten, having been supplanted by Lisa's children as the motivating factor. 

In the end, _The Angry Hills_ is a really three movies. It starts as a Hitchcockian spy thriller. But before that premise can take off, it drops it and sets up a war action picture. And before _that_ can pay off, it tries out a heist picture. Had it followed through on any of these premises, it would likely have turned out better[^1]. Instead where given the begining of one movie, the middle of another, and the end of yet another. Quite a disappointment given the talent involved.



The film looks good, especially when it's in Athens. The location filming, and rich use of shadows give it a great sense of atmosphere. The cast is solid too. Mitchum is great as a reluctant hero, and Stanley Baker is a surprisingly multi-dimensional villian. 

[^1]: Okay, maybe not the wartime action premise. That was just silly.
