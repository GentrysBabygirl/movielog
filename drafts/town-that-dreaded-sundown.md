_The Town That Dreaded Sundown_ starts with a prolog recounting the murders that occured in Texarkaana in ?. It talks about how the killer was never caught, and how the original film _The Town That Dreaded Sundown (19??)_ screens every year in Texarakana on Halloween. The film opens on one of those screenings. It's a drive in screening. The camera pans down to a teen couple sitting on the hood of a car. The guy seems into the film, but the girl looks uneasy. He picks up on this and asks her if she want's to go. She does and the they head out. As they leave, the camera picks up a preacher warning of the evil's of the film and reminding the patrons that people really died.

By genre definitions, the film is a slasher, but I'm always hesitant to use that term. For many people, that equates to the Friday the 13th and Halloween series of films, which for the most part, were more monster and survival horror films. _The Town That Dreaded Sundown_ is more of a violent mystery. Victims are stalked and murdered in a brutal but stylish manner and we work along with the protagonist to deduce the killer's identity from a number of suspects. To that end, _The Town That Dreaded Sundown_ may be the first rural giallo.
