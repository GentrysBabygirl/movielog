_The Town That Dreaded Sundown_ starts with a prolog recounting the murders that occured in Texarkaana in ?. It talks about how the killer was never caught, and how the original film _The Town That Dreaded Sundown (19??)_ screens every year in Texarakana on Halloween. The film opens on one of those screenings. It's at a drive-in. The camera pans down to a teen couple sitting on the hood of a car. The guy seems into the film, but the girl looks uneasy. He picks up on this and asks her if she want's to go. She does and the they head out. As they leave, the camera picks up a preacher warning of the evil's of the film and reminding the patrons that people really died.

The couple head out for a quiet, deserted area where they can be alone. As they drive, they're shown in a tilted angle. It's an on-the-nose gimmick that foreshadows one of the film's biggest weaknesses. 

Soon they're parked. They start kissing but the girl spots a man in the nearby woods. He's dressed just like the killer from the movie. But this is no prank. He breaks the car's window with the but of his revolver, then forces the girl to turn around while he stabs the boy to death.

And we're off and running. By genre definitions, the film is a slasher, but I'm always hesitant to use that term. For many people, that equates to the Friday the 13th and Halloween series of films, which for the most part, were more monster and survival horror films. _The Town That Dreaded Sundown_ is more of a violent mystery. Victims are stalked and murdered in a brutal but stylish manner and we work along with the protagonist to deduce the killer's identity from a number of suspects. To that end, _The Town That Dreaded Sundown_ may be the first rural giallo.

There's a lot to like. The performances are solid, especially the supporting cast. The script is creative in its approach. Neither a remake, nor a sequal. 

And the bad. Camera is too busy. Every shot doesn't need a gimmick. The ending feels obligitory. What if she just left? What if the message was that the killer would always be there as long as we were there. Would dovetail with the original's ambigious ending.
