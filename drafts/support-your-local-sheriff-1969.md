James Garner plays an easy-going drifter who chances into the job of sheriff in a frontier boom town. Through a combination of quick wits and improbable skills with a six-shooter, he tames the town. Walter Brennan plays the patriarch of the Danby clan, the film's chief antagonist. Bruce Dern is his dim-witted son. Jack Elam is the town yokel who winds up as Garner's deputy.

One of the running gags in _Support Your Local Sheriff!_ revolves around the local brothel being named "Madame Orr's". Another revolves around the female lead (Joan Hackett) ending up either covered in mud, stuck in a tree, or on fire. The script for _Support Your Local Sheriff!_ isn't very funny.

And yet, Garner is impossible to dislike. He seems almost bemused by the script's forced humor plays well opposite Elam and Harry Morgan (who plays the town Mayor).

Unfortunately, Garner can't do it all. Hacket's character is written as an annoyance and her performance doesn't do much to change that. Perhaps the writers were trying to parody the rock-solid Howard Hawks female leads, but writing the only woman as a clown doesn't work.

_Support Your Local Sheriff!_ is one of the best western comedies. Unfortunately, this less of a reflection on the quality of the film, then the difficulty of the genre.
