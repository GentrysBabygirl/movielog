After a passable opening, Karloff disappears and the story morphs into a would-be clone of the first half of Hitchcock's Number Seventeen (1932). The atmospheric photography can't overcome the stiff cast, slow script, and overbearing score. By the time Karloff does return, he seems as bored with the film as we are. This film was considered "lost" for over thirty years. Maybe it should have stayed that way.
