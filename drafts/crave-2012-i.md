_Crave_ tells the story of Aiden, a Detroit-based freelance photographer who makes the majority of his money photographing the city's grizzly crime scenes, which he gets access to thanks to his buddy Pete, a detective Aiden knows from his AA meetings.

Aiden is also losing his mind. He sees two young men harassing a woman on a train and fantasizes about shooting them in the knee-caps. He hears voices. He envisions smashing the head of loud-mouth at an AA meeting. He hears more voices. He's robbed at gun point in a conveinence store. While fantasizing about shooting his assailant in the head, Aiden tracks the robber via police wave shorthand. Arriving before the police, he finds the remains of a botched robbery, and a gun. 

Meanwhile, Aiden's also been fantasizing about his young neighbor, Virginia. She's got an unkept boyfriend named Ravi who doesn't seem to treat her well. In an improbable, but charming sequence of events, Aiden becomes the man he fantasizes about and takes Virginia to bed. 

But Virginia soon senses Aiden's unstable nature and returns to Ravi. Aiden fantasizes about rescuing her, leading to the inevitable meeting of Aiden, Ravi, and Aiden's gun.

_Crave_ the film mirrors its protagonist. You want to root for it, but it just seems so unsure of itself. The perpetual voice-over narration feels like a shortcut. Instead of showing us Aiden's deteriorating state, the film tells us. Yet, much like Aiden, the film can be charming. Whether it's him bumbling through the world's most awkward blackmail attempt, or joking to Virginia that he's old enough to be her dad in relation to their 13-year age gap, the film never takes itself too seriously. While this adds to the film's enjoyment, it makes me wonder if the filmmakers were afraid to really commit to the material.
