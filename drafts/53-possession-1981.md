Adjani leaves her husband, played by Neill, and for a self-help guru, only to leave him for a tentacled creature. Along the way, Neill meets Adjani's doppelgänger, Adjani has an abortion in a subway tunnel, and Neill walks in on Adjani having sex with what can best be described as a demon squid. If that sounds bizarre, you have no idea. Zulawksi delivers a very uncompromising vision and the raw performances from Adjani and Neill as their marriage crumbles keep any hint of camp at bay, but between the monster, the doppelgängers, the violence, and the shots of the Berlin Wall, it's unclear exactly what he's trying to say. As far as this film goes, compared to Zulawski, David Lynch is positively restrained.
