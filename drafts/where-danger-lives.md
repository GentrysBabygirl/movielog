Ordinarly, I like to warn readers that I'm going to spoil plot points. In the case of _Where Danger Lives_, I don't think it matters. This is one of those films where it takes the hero the entire film to deduce what the audience figures out in the first ten minutes.

The film opens with doctor ? treating a patient. Robert Mitchum plays ?. The patient is a little girl. ? is telling her a story about elephants. This is the script's way of telling us that ? is a wholesome kind of guy. Mitchum, like most of the performers, is miscast, but we accept him in the role. 

After finishing with the little girl, ? clocks out, eager for a big date with his best girl ?. ? is another wholesome character, a nurse at the hospital. But ? has to cancel his plans when he's called to assist with a patient that just came in, a suicide attempt.

The patient is ?, played by ?. This is where the film really falls apart. ? was the latest "protege" of RKO owner Howard Hughes. She's wrong for the role. 

? treats her and then begins seeing her socially. He falls hard. But she has to leave with her father. ? has a few too many and goes to her house. There he confronts her father ?, played by third-billed Claude Rains in his only scene. Here ? discovers what we already suspected. He's not her father at all, but her husband! (Cue ominous music: Duh-duh-dum!)

? and ? get into a little scuffle. ? knocks down ? who pummels ? with a fireplace poker. ? clocks ?, knocking him out cold. ?, still reeling from the fireplace poker blows to his head, stumbles into the bathroom to get some water. When he returns, ? tells ? that ? is dead. At this point it's obvious to anyone watching that ? killed her husband while ? was out of the room. Since the rest of the film is predicated on ? believing he did it, a series of contrived plot mechanations are necessary. The pair "just miss" the news, someone draws whiskers on a mug shot. 

Anyway, ? and ? set out for the Mexico border. ? has the worst concussion you've ever seen. He blacks out, loses the ability to think straight and, by the time the film's predictable conclusion rolls around, is paralized on the left side of his body.

This is a ludicrious film built around a flimsy plot device.
