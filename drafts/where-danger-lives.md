Ordinarly, I like to warn readers that I'm going to spoil plot points. In the case of _Where Danger Lives_, I don't think it matters. This is one of those films where it takes the hero the entire film to deduce what the audience figures out in the first ten minutes.

The film opens with doctor Jeff Cameron treating a patient. Robert Mitchum plays Jeff. The patient is a little girl. Jeff is telling her a story about elephants. This is the script's way of telling us that Jeff is a wholesome kind of guy. Mitchum, like most of the performers, is miscast, but we accept him in the role. 

After finishing with the little girl, Jeff clocks out, eager for a big date with his best girl Julie. Julie is another wholesome character, a nurse at the hospital. But Jeff has to cancel his plans when he's called to assist with a patient that just came in, a suicide attempt.

The patient is a woman, Margo, played by Faith Domergue. This is where the film really falls apart. Faith Domergue 	Domergue was the latest "protege" of RKO owner Howard Hughes. She's wrong for the role. 

Jeff treats her and then begins seeing her socially. He falls hard. But she has to leave with her father. Jeff has a few too many and goes to her house. There he confronts her father Mr. Lannington, played by third-billed Claude Rains in his only scene. Here Jeff discovers the first of many things we already suspected. Lannington isn't her father at all, but her husband! (Cue ominous music: Duh-duh-dum!)

Jeff and Lannington get into a little scuffle. Jeff knocks down Lannington who pummels Jeff with a fireplace poker. Jeff clocks Lannington, knocking him out cold. Jeff, still reeling from the fireplace poker blows to his head, stumbles into the bathroom to get some water. When he returns, Margo tells Jeff that Lannington is dead. At this point it's obvious to anyone watching that Margo killed her husband while Jeff was out of the room. But, since the rest of the film is predicated on Jeff believing he did it, a series of contrived plot mechanations are necessary. The pair "just miss" the news, someone draws whiskers on a mug shot. 

Anyway, Jeff and Margo set out for the Mexico border. Jeff has the worst concussion you've ever seen. He blacks out, loses the ability to think straight and, by the time the film's predictable conclusion rolls around, is paralized on the left side of his body.

This is a ludicrious film built around a flimsy plot device.
