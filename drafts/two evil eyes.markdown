- Synopsis: Two hour-long movies based on stories by Edgar Allan Poe: "The Facts in the Case of Mr. Valdemar" by George A. Romero, and "The Black Cat" by Dario Argento.

Thank God for home video and the fast-forward button. Take advantage and skip the first movie. Skip the ludicrous casting of Ramy Zada as Adrienne Barbeau's former lover. (They were supposedly an item back when she was a stewardess who caught the titular Valdemar's eye. Now, assuming Barbeau was in her early twenties at the time, that would make Zada about ten years old as he's _thirteen years her junior_.) Skip the flat acting. Skip the uninspired direction. Skip the frightless script. In short, skip this would-be Tales from the Crypt episode and go straight to Dario Argento's far superior second half.

Argento's opening scene has more style and substance than Romero's entire hour and it only gets better. Harvey Keitel plays Rod (short for Roderick) Usher, a tabloid photographer driven to madness by the gruesome images he sees night after night. 

Or is he? Argento makes a  case that Usher was born a sociopath and the job was a merely an unconscious way of satiating his murderous desires until he finally gives in and murders an animal, and from there, it's a short leap to people. After that, the bodies (and Poe references) pile up as the film builds to it's classic conclusion. Along the way, Argento sprinkles in some supernatural elements, but they're presented as though they may be figments of Usher's imagination. It's a wild, stylish ride that saves the movie --provided you made it through Romero's awful first half.

The only real misstep is Keitel's wardrobe. Harvey's a great actor and a good choice, but he should never, ever, wear a beret.
