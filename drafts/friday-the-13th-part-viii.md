I was about to start high school when this movie came out. I was too young to see it, not that I wanted to. It was the eighth entry in what had become a disregarded franchise. Slasher films were passe.

But I remember this movie's release. This was well before the Internet was a household thing, but that didn't stop one bit of news from spreading. In a film called _Jason Takes Manhattan_, Jason didn't actually get to New York until the last fifteen minutes or so. Instead, he spends most of the time on a boat.

On a boat? Really? I remember envisioning Jason hiding out on yacht, waiting to for landfall to begin his rampage. It never occurred to me that most of the _killing_ would happen on the boat as well.

That said, it's not as bad as it could be. The majority of the film does take place on a boat, but if the marketing department hadn't insisted on the Manhattan title, fans probably wouldn't have minded so much. This entry once again sees the protagonist saddled with a useless melodramatic sub plot. But the supporting cast is far more tolerable than the last installment.

Perhaps this most dissappointing aspect of this entry is not that it takes so long to get to New York, but rather that once they arrive Jason fixates on two teens. He's got tunnel vision. He walks through whole swaths of people and leaves them alone. Jason in a major city should be like a one-man apocolypse, killing anyone and anything within reach. He does off some street punks, but that's about it.
