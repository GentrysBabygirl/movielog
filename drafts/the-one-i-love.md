Whoa there. There be spoilers below. Big old spoilers. The kind of spoilers that take a great deal of the magic out of _The One I Love_. If you haven't seen it and you're on the fence, see it. Hell, if you're not on the fence, see it. It may have its problems, but it's original enough to merit a look.

Still here? Okay, here we go.

David Lynch has built an entire genre of films. A _Lynchian_ film usually features some strange, inexplicable event and characters whose motivations are never explicitely verbalized. _The One I Love_ certainly has some _Lynchian_ touches, but it makes the critical flaw of verbalizing it's character's motivations. By defining them, the rest of the story is forced to serve them. When it doesn't you have plot holes.

And boy does this one have a lot of them. The whole film doens't make any sense really. What was the point of imprisoning couples there? Why transform the previous couples into dopplegangers of the next ones? Why can they only leave after the other two have broken up? Why did Ted Danson send them in the first place? All of these questions wouldn't be so problematic if the script hadn't verbalized that the doppleganger's were a previous couple who'd been transformed into ? and ?, and now planned to break them up in order to be able to leave the retreat. Imagine if the script didn't explain it. If that recording studio and computer were left out, if, when ? confronted ? about not being real, she just sat quietly and stared at him. Now you'd _really_ have something _Lynchian_. 

Still, despite it's flaws, _The One I Love_ impressed me. It's a brilliant concept that's handled with the perfect tone.
