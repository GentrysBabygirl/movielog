After moving to his wife's small English village, an American mathematician, played by Hoffman, becomes the target of increasing harassment by the local men. Peckinpah's gut-punch of a film is a brutal look at humanity's baser instincts. On the surface, Hoffman is a man pushed to his breaking point, yet much of his fate is his own making, which raises the question: Was Hoffman avoiding confrontation, or just seeking justification? Peckinpah doesn't provide any answers, just a bleak mirror for us to confront our own darker impulses.
