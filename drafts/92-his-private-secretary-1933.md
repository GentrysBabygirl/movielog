Wealth socialite Wayne gets chewed out by his father Barlow and put to work collecting a debt owed by Knapp's minister father. Wayne falls for Knapp and spends the movie's first half winning her over. The two marry, which causes a rift between Wayne and Barlow, who assume's Knapp's a gold digger without even meeting her. Knapp goes to Barlow to smooth things over, but a mixup lands her hired as his secretary. The early scenes the highpoint of the film, with Wayne as a drunken playboy checking out women's ankles in his rearview mirror. Unfortunately, there isn't much chemistry between him and Knapp, and the third act plot point with Knapp leaving because he gets drunk at a party is something of a head-scratcher.
