_For the Defense_ stars William Powell as <>. Bill is a slick defense lawyer famous for using any technicality or loophole to get his clients an acquittal, despite their obvious guilt. He’s so well-respected in the underworld that, when his car’s stolen, the crooks return it after getting a look at the registration.

Bill’s seeing a showgirl, <>, played by Kay Francis. <> also has another suitor in the form of <>. He’s a nice enough guy, and what he lacks in swagger he makes up for in persistence. <> wants Bill to marry her, but he’s not the marrying kind. Realizing Bill will never give her the life she wants, <> agrees to marry <>. They celebrate at the local speak easy.

Early the next morning, <> drives <> home. He’s pie-eyed and gropes at her, causing her to hit and kill a stranded motorist on the side of the road. Recognizing what it would do to her reputation if she were discovered out with him at the early hour, <> insists she flee the scene. <> takes the rap for the death.

<> pursues Bill to take <>’s case. But as the evidence comes to light, Bill realizes <> was with <>. Things look bad for <>. Soon, Bill realizes he’ll have to chose between <>’s reputation and <>’s liberty. <> wants to take the stand to exonerate <>, but Bill won’t let her ruin her reputation. There’s another option, but it means crossing a line Bill had set for himself, as well as risking everything he’s worked for.

As melodramas go, _For the Defense_ isn’t a bad one. Early on, when Bill’s riding high, his urbane charm, affinity for alcohol, and underworld connections foreshadow Powell’s famous turn as Nick Charles in the _Thin Man_ series of films. Fancis plays well opposite him and doesn’t overact her part.

But the film sees both of them pulling the soap opera stand-by of delivering a line and, mid-sentence, turning to gaze at nothing in particular for dramatic effect. It’s an annoying affectation that mars an otherwise passable hour and five minutes.

Oh, and look fast for Gabby Hayes in an uncredited bit part as a speakeasy waiter.
