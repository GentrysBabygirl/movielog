_What were they thinking?_

That sums up a my reaction to _Friday the 13th Part V: A New Beginning (1985)_. After nailing the formula in _Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter (1984)_ , they throw everything out the window and nearly kill the franchise.

The film follows Tommy, the twelve-year-old boy who survived the previous film by hacking Jason’s body to pieces with a machete. In a startling bit of plausibility, he’s spent the previous six years in a mental institution. He’s eighteen now, putting this film in the then-future of 1990[^1]. 

As a protagonist, Tommy leaves much to be desired. He says all of two dozen words throughout the entire film. His emotions run the gamut of confused to unsure. 

Tommy is also prone to violent outbursts. These only serve as a red herring, however, as the one time his vicious fighting skills could actually be of use, they fail him.

Anyway, the film opens with Tommy arriving at kind of halfway house for problem teens. It’s not made clear, but one presumes this is due to his aging out of the state system. After one of the residents offs another with an axe, an unseen assailant begins murdering residents, staff, and pretty much everyone on screen.

Harkening back to the original film, this entry is less a monster movie and more of a mystery thriller. But execution is sloppy. Characters are introduced and killed in the same scene. Several of the performances veer well into camp, such as the backwoods mother and son living next door to the halfway house. Worst of all, the eventual reveal is unsatisfying. It requires some awkward exposition to explain the killer’s motive.

But time has been kind to _Friday the 13th Part V: A New Beginning (1985)_. Knowing that the franchise rights itself with the subsequent film, fans can appreciate this entry in a so-bad-it’s-good kind of way. The nonsense plot, Tommy’s non-dialog, and the over-the-top characters are all good for a laugh. 

[^1]: I had to look this up. The series timeline gets really crazy since they reference continuity but not specific years.
