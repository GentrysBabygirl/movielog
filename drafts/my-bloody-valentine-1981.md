_My Bloody Valentine_ is a solid little slasher that bucks a lot of the genre conventions. 

The story takes place in a Nova Scotian mining town. Years earlier, a cave in trapped a group of miners on Valentine's night. The men that were supposed to be on watch were at a Valentines party and the sole survivor resorted to cannibalism to stay alive. In the days following his rescue, the survivor donned his mining gear, complete with gas-mask, and murdered the negligent men. The town has not celebrated Valentine's day since.

But, of course, now a fresh group of young miners and their girlfriends want to have a Valentine's party. And, of course, someone has donned a miner's outfit complete with gas mask and has begun offing locals. They mayor and sherrif try to keep the killings under wraps, and cancel the Valentine's party. The frustrated miners decide to have a party anyway, up at the mine. Soon, a handful of guys and girls find themselves trapped underground with a killer.

Like _Friday the 13th (1980)_[^1], the story revolves around a tragedy occuring because of neglect due to indulgance. Like _Halloween (1978)_ it features a masked killer and a holiday theme. But _My Bloody Valentine_ eschews the routine settings of a wooded cabin or suburban home and substitutes a dank, dark, coal mine. It's an inspired choice, but one that could have backfired if they hadn't filmed on-location. Another inspired choice comes in the form of the finale. Instead of the genre-staple "final girl", this film allows for more than one survivor. This is addition by subtraction. By avoiding the final girl trope, the film avoids the contrived plotting that goes into having a group of people whittled down to one, despite the natural human impulse to stick together. 

The only thing working against the film are the Nova Scotian accents. They sound too cheerful and polite. 



[^1]: In a subtle nod, the film sets Valentine's is on a Saturday, making the preceding Friday the 13th of February.
