Howard Hawks once said that a good movie consisted of _"three great scenes and no bad ones."_  Hammer's first entry in its _Dracula_ franchise gives us exactly that.

The film opens with Jonathan Harker having arrived at Castle Dracula. The Count is not there to meet him, of course, as it's still daylight.

At nightfall, the Count makes his entrance. Like Lugosi before him, Christopher Lee, uses his height and piercing gaze to command our attention on the screen. But where Lugosi’s Hungarian accent belied his character’s demonic nature, Lee’s cultured English lends his interpretation a more overt sinister charm. This scene provides Lee his only lines in the film, but he makes them count.

We learn that Harker is to be the Count’s librarian and catalog the castle’s literary treasures. So far, so familiar, right? Sure, in Todd Browning’s 1931 adaptation it was Renfield who arrived at the castle, but this is more in keeping with the source material.

Except Harker isn’t a librarian at all, he’s there to kill the vampire count.

It’s an inspired plot-twist that acknowledges the audience’s familiarity with the story while making it clear early-on that this film intends to go it's own way. This leads us into the first great scene.

Later that night, Harker prowls around the castle and finds a young woman. She sports ruby red lips, brilliant blue eyes and ample cleavage. She begs Harker to help her escape. Harker feigns ignorance. She persists. His resolve weakens. Grateful, she bursts into tears and buries her head in his shoulder. The music shifts. We see her blue eyes fix on Harker’s neck, then close as her ruby red lips draw back to reveal fangs. She bites Harker.

Just as she does, Dracula bursts into the room with a piercing shriek. Lee is feral and demonic. Shown in close up, His eyes are bloodshot red. His gore-smeared lips are pulled back to reveal blood-covered fangs. The shot lasts all of a few seconds, but it still packs a punch. 

Harker wakes up late the following afternoon. Checking the bite on his neck, he knows he hasn’t much time. He heads down to the crypt.

Harker fails to dispatch the Count, but does succeed in staking his vampire bride. To settle the score, Dracula heads for Harker's home, intent on claiming Harker’s fiance, Lucy, as a replacement.

It’s twenty minutes into the movie before top-billed Peter Cushing shows up. It’s a testament to the strength Lee’s performance that we hardly notice. That said, once Cushing makes his arrival, he owns the film. His Van Helsing is every bit the equal of Edward Van Sloan’s in Browning’s original. Unflappable, driven and able to command a room despite his slim stature, Cushing is magnetic on screen.

The second great scene happens at about three-quarters point. Dracula has turned Lucy who's now preying on children. Her brother Arthur has gone to her crypt at night, to assure himself that she’s not a vampire. To Arthur’s horror, he finds Lucy returning to her tomb, leading a young girl. Lucy is delighted to see him. “Come, let me kiss you,” she says as she advances toward him, baring her fangs. Arthur is transfixed. 

But before she can consumate the act, Van Helsing appears and thrusts a crucifix into her face. She backs away in agony. Van Helsing, jaw set, eyes full of cold detachment, advances. She's cornered. Van Helsing presses the crucifix to her forehead. The flesh smoldurs and burns, leaving the imprint of the cross. Van Helsing stares down, unmoved. Lucy shrieks and flees back to her tomb.

It's a crackerjack scene that works just as well today as it did half a century ago. The practical effects still look great and Cushing's performance in the scene is perfect.

The third great scene is the finale. Arthur and Van Helsing have chased Dracula back to his castle. Dawn is fast approaching. Van Helsing catches the count before he can disappear down a secret passage. The two grapple. The count looks to have the upper hand until Van Helsing, in an very swashbuckling move, vaults attop a long table, runs the length and launches himself into the air, grabbing the tapestry curtains as he lands, pulling them down to let in the morning sun. Dracula tries to flee, but Van Helsing pins him in place by fashioning a make-shift cross out of candle holders.

It’s an inspired ending, but what makes it so great is seeing Lee and Cushing opposite one-another. While they shared the screen for a split second earlier in the film, this is their first real scene together. Neither has any dialog, but none is needed. The entire film has built to this moment and both men perform admirably [^1].

I vacillate between this film and Browning’s original for my favorite Dracula interpretation. I prefer Lee’s grittier performance, but I dislike the overt physicality. This Dracula runs, grapples, and digs holes. It lends the character a vulnerability that softens his edge. Still, his charisma more then compensates. Lugosi may have defined the stereotype, but Lee defined the monster.

[^1]: It’s a shame that Lee and Cushing wouldn’t meet again as Dracula and Van Helsing until 1972’s disappointing _Dracula A.D. 1972_. Cushing starred in the immediate sequel _The Brides of Dracula_ and Lee returned in the third installment _Dracula: Prince of Darkness_ which, sadly, lacked Cushing.
