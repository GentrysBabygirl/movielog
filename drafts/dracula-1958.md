Howard Hawks once said that a good movie consisted of _"three great scenes and no bad ones."_  Hammer's first entry in it's _Dracula_ franchise gives us exactly that.

The film opens with Jonathan Harker having arrived at Castle Dracula. The Count is not there to meet him, of course, as it's still daylight.

The first great scene comes next. At nightfall, the Count makes his entrance. Like Lugosi before him, Christopher Lee, uses his height and piercing gaze to command our attention on the screen. But where Lugosi’s Hungarian accent belied his character’s demonic nature, Lee’s cultured English lends his interpretation a more overt sinister charm. This scene provides Lee his only lines in the film, but he makes them count.

We learn that Harker is to be the Count’s librarian and catalog the castle’s literary treasures.
So far, so familiar, right? Sure, in Todd Browning’s 1931 adaptation it was Renfield who arrived at the castle, but this is more in keeping with the source material.

Except Harker isn’t a librarian at all, he’s there to kill the vampire count.

It’s an inspired plot-twist that acknowledges the audience’s familiarity with the story while making it clear early-on that this film intends to go it's own way.

Harker fails to dispatch the Count, but does succeed in staking one of his vampire brides. To settle the score, Dracula heads for Harker's home, intent on claiming his fiance, Lucy, as a replacement.

Top-billed Peter Cushing doesn’t even show up until 20 minutes into the film, but we hardly notice. That said, once he makes his arrival, Cushing owns the film. His Van Helsing is every bit the equal of Edward Van Sloan’s. Unflappable, driven and able to command a room despite his slim stature, Cushing is magnetic on screen.

The second great scene happens at about the midway point. Dracula has turned Lucy who's now preying on young children. Her brother Arthur has gone to her crypt at night, to assure himself the stories can't be true. There he meets Lucy, or a least a ? version of her. Arthur is transfixed. She embraces him, pressing her chest into his. We see her tilt her head back, open her mouth, and bare down on his neck with her fangs.

But before she can consumate the act, Van Helsing appears and thrusts a crucifix into her face. She backs away in agony. Van Helsing, jaw set, eyes full of cold detachment, advances. She's cornered. Van Helsing presses the crucifix to her forehead. The flesh smoldurs and burns, leaving the imprint of the cross. She shrieks and flees back to her tomb.

It's a crackerjack scene that works just as well today as it did half a century ago. The practical effects still look great and Cushing's performance in the scene is perfect.

It’s a shame that Lee and Cushing wouldn’t meet again as Dracula and Van Helsing until 1972’s disappointing Dracula AD 1972. Cushing starred in the immediate sequel The Brides of Dracula and Lee returned in the third installment Dracula: Prince of Darkness which, sadly, lacked Cushing.
