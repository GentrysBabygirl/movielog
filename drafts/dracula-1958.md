_Dracula_ (_Horror of Dracula_ here in the states) is the first entry in Hammer Films’ _Dracula_ franchise. 

The script by Jimmy Sangster is a an efficient remix of the Bram Stoker source material. It opens with Jonathan Harker arriving at Castle Dracula. He is to be the Count’s librarian, cataloging the Castle’s literary treasures. 

So far, so familiar, right? Sure, in Todd Browning’s 1931 adaptation it was Renfield who arrived at the castle, but this is more in keeping with the source material.

Except Harker isn’t a librarian at all, he’s there to kill the vampire count. 

It’s an inspired plot-twist that acknowledges the audience’s familiarity with the source material while making it clear early on that Sangster intends to go his own way with the material. 

Top-billed Peter Cushing doesn’t even show up until 20 minutes into the film, but we don’t mind because in the interim we’re treated to the best interpretation of the Count since Lugosi.

Like Lugosi before him, Christopher Lee, uses his height and piercing gaze to command your attention on the screen. But where Lugosi’s Hungarian accent belied his character’s demonic nature, Lee’s cultured English lends his interpretation a more overt sinister charm. Impressive considering he had all of thirteen lines.

But back to Cushing. As good as Lee is, this is Cushing’s film and he owns it. His Van Helsing is every bit the equal of Edward Van Sloan’s. Unflappable, driven and able to command a room despite his slim stature, Cushing is magnetic on screen. 

It’s a shame that Lee and Cushing wouldn’t meet again as Dracula and Van Helsing until 1972’s disappointing _Dracula AD 1972_. Cushing starred in the immediate sequel _The Brides of Dracula_ and Lee returned in the third installment _Dracula: Prince of Darkness_ which, sadly, lacked Cushing.
