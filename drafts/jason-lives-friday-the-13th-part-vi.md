Jason lives. Not _Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives_ but _Jason Lives: Friday the 13th Part VI_. After the head-scratching mess that was _Friday the 13th Part V: A New Beginning (1985)_, somebody in Paramount’s marketing division must have been scared kids would stop reading after the _Friday the 13th_ part of the title. I’m not sure things were that dire, but it does give you a sense of this entry’s mandate.

More-or-less ignoring the last film’s events, this entry opens with Tommy Jarvis determined to rid himself of the specter of Jason. To that end, he plans to dig up Jason’s corpse and incinerate it. 

He digs up the corpse all right, but a bolt of lightening reanimates the maggot filled corpse. Tommy manages to escape and attempts to warn the local sherrif. Of course, the adult authority figures don’t believe him. They run him out of town.

Meanwhile, Jason resumes his murderous ways. He offs some corporate paintballers, and a few teen camp counselors before Tommy gets back to town. Thinking Tommy committed the murders himself, the sherrif locks Tommy up. 

Not to worry though, the sheriff’s plucky teen daughter Megan, frees Tommy from his cell. Together, they race to Camp Crystal Lake to stop Jason once and for all.

This entry cements the franchise’s transition from deranged madman to supernatural monster. This Jason has super human strength and can’t be killed by bullets. There’s even a nice nod that Jason is something of a force of nature, as early on Tommy looks to incinerate him, but the skies open up and the resulting rain prevents him from striking a match. This is the iconic Jason. 

While the camp present in the previous entry is gone, there is a great streak of self-referential humor. As Jason stalks a group of children, one of the boys looks at another and asks sarcastically: “So, what did you want to be when you grew up?”

The biggest problem is that, aside from Tommy and the Megan, none of the supporting cast has any kind of story. They exist only as fodder for Jason and thus, when Jason’s not on the screen, they’re boring. Really, the same goes for Tommy and Megan. They’re actually given things to do, but they’re not up to the flimsy drama. They can’t carry the film. Thom Mathews’ performance as Tommy kept reminding me of Michael Dudikoff in American Ninja. Except minus the ninja bad-assery. 

_Jason Lives: Friday the 13th Part VI_ isn’t an awful movie. The depiction of Jason is great, and the fourth-wall humor is a nice touch. But despite the humor, the story’s drama weighs it down. The only character we end up caring about is Jason and when he’s off-screen, this entry is a snooze.
