Synopsis: A cowboy (John Wayne) uncovers the secrets behind an abandoned mine haunted by the mysterious Phantom.

Even by his early B-Western standards, Haunted Gold is one of John Wayne's low points. Lacking both Yakima Canutt's famed stunt work, and Gabby Hayes as Wayne's customary sidekick, this Warner Brothers entry is missing the only two bright spots in Wayne's early work.

What we have instead is Blue Washington as Wayne's "yessa" sidekick in an unfunny and off-putting performance that the filmmakers nonetheless seem to highlight at every possible turn. Incidentally, despite appearing in films for 25 more years, this marked Washington's last screen credit. 

Framing this mess is a Scooby-Doo like plot involving a supposedly haunted mine that manages zero chills and just as little intrigue. It's very talky, involving half-shares in mines and frame-ups, betrayals, and, though it makes no sense, a Phantom. Indeed, if it weren't for the presence of John Wayne this disaster would be utterly unwatchable, and thus is recommended only for Wayne die-hards.
