It may lack the subtext and visual flair of Rosemary's Baby, but its mix of camp and genuinely creepy moments hits more often than it misses--if only just. Sarandon is great (mustache and all) and the supporting cast is a who's-who of once and future stars. That, and Beverly D'Angelo's scene takes camp to new levels.
