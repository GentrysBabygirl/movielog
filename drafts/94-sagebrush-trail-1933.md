Imprisoned for a murder he didn't commit, Wayne breaks out of jail and eludes his pursuers by hiding underwater. He's then befriended by outlaw Chandler and given sanctuary by Chandler's gang, but gang-leader Yakima Canutt is suspicious and orders Wayne to rob the town general store to prove himself. Chandler volunteers to partner with Wayne, but things get complicated when Wayne falls for shop clerk Shubert. Soon, Wayne's playing both sides, and getting wounded in the process. Along the way, Chandler confesses to the murder rap Wayne's fleeing, though Chandler has no idea another man was convicted. It's a lot of improbable coincidences, made worse by the flat supporting cast,  and fight scenes where the performers punch each other in the shoulder. It's not a total loss, as Canutt's stunts (including one where he climbs aboard a moving stagecoach from the bottom) and the surprisingly good underwater photography make this passable, albeit just barely.
