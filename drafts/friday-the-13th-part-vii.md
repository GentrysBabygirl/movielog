It shouldn't be this hard. Really. It's a simple formula. First, assemble some college-age kids the audience can relate to. Then, put them in an isolated location. Give them something to do that would interest the audience. Usually,  this involves getting laid.  Endear one of the female teens to the audience by having her make good choices. Next, set Jason loose to pick off the teens in various creative ways until only the one who made good choices remains. Finally, dispose of Jason in a suitably gruesome manner.

A simple formula. It's spectacular how badly _Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood (1988)_ botches it.
The script attempts to replicate the scenario from #{part4}. A house full of teens (complete with misfit) next to a house with a single mom and her teenage daughter. Had it just done that, things might have worked. But no, it has to recreate the "boy who cried wolf" plot and forced melodrama from #{part 6} too.

But that's not all. After establishing Jason as a supernatural monster in #{part6}, someone had the unfortunate idea to bring in more supernatural elements. So the story opens on house set on the lake in which Jason ended up chained at the end of #{part6}. We see a young girl standing outside the house door. Inside, we can hear her parents fighting. The mom's yelling that the dad promised he wouldn't drink so much. The dad's telling her to shut up and smacking her around. It aims for drama but plays like charicature.

The girl runs down to the lake, walks the length of a small pier, and gets in a small fishing boat. She motors out to the middle of the lake. The dad, dressed like Stewart Smally, comes running out of the house down to the pier. He yells for her to come back. The mom comes out too and joins in the yelling. The dad advances down the pier. The little girl gives the dad the stink-eye of death and the pier starts to shake. Not a rumble, but a full-on cartoonish wobble with the pylons jutting several feet into the air. It's an expensive-looking effect, but laughable.

The pier crumbles down, taking the dad with it. We flash forward[^1] to the little girl, now seventeen, waking up in a car. Her name is ?. She's on her way back to the lake at the coaxing of her smarmy psychiatrist, Dr. ?. The good doctor says she must confront the death of her father by revisting the scene.

Conveniently, there's a house full of teens next door. The hunky one takes an instant interest in ?. Perhaps he sees something we don't.

A few needless scenes later, ? inadvertently wakes up Jason via her telekenisis. The hows and whys of this aren't explained. Jason martches out of the water, past the two houses and goes a couple of miles up the road to off a pair of teens before circling back to continue his rampage.The why of this isn't explained either.

Meanwhile, ?'s mom uncovers Dr. ?'s true intentions. There's a lot of over emoting and dues ex machina that lands ?, the mom, and the doctor all on foot in the darkened woods. Prime fodder for Jason[^2].
Everything culminates with ? using her telekentic powers to hurl flower pots at Jason. Seriously.

Let's start with the good. Zombie Jason looks great. He's a great big hulking monster.

That's it for the good.

This is an awful movie. The characters (save Jason) aren't just flat or underdeveloped. They're aggressively annoying. Everyone over-emotes. Characters act without any clear motivation. This wouldn't be so bad if the film didn't take itself so seriously. The black humor in the previous entry is gone. So is the manic campiness that accompanied part 5. Instead we're asked to suffer through scene-after-scene of overwraught melodrama. ? is a passive protagonist that spends a large portion of the film crying. The kids next door seem like strangers thrown together rather than friends.
