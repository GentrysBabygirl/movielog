- Synopsis: A writer (Richard Widmark) struggles to protect a young girl (Nastassja Kinski) raised by a  Satanic priest (Christopher Lee) as part of a plan to bring about the end of the world.  

Picture this: In a staged, antiseptic facsimile of young girl's bedroom, a woman is giving birth. Strips of white cloth bind her wrists to the headboard and clamp her knees and ankles shut, giving the baby no escape. Arms spread, knees clenched, she lays crucified to the bed. Her face glistens with sweat as her back arches and her body spasms from another contraction. Her belly swells. Beside her, a middle-aged priest stands waiting, smiling with eager eyes. 

Sound disturbing? You betcha. How about this:

Through the eyes of a pregnant woman laying on her back, we see her bulging womb. Her legs are open, knees up, in the traditional birthing position. Still through her eyes, we see something crawling up from between her legs. At first glimpse it appears to be a baby, but no, it's a horrid combination of baby and beast with a monstrous jaw and reptilian eyes. Covered in blood, it writhes between her legs, smearing her thighs and stomach with blood. Still through her eyes, we see her reach down and stroke the creature's grotesque head. Now her midsection is awash in a thick, almost syrupy, blood as she gently pushes the thing back down, between her legs. Still through her eyes, we hear her moan in a combination of agony and ecstasy as she forces the monstrosity *back up into her womb*.

Yeah.

Now, in execution, the quality of the creature effects is laughable, but it doesn't matter because the nature of the scene is so damn unsettling. If the whole movie had been as good as these scenes, To the Devil a Daughter would be a classic. 

But it's not. Richard Widmark, looking heavy and bored, is just cashing a paycheck, and the ending, with dialog that reads straight from an elementary school playground, is so ridiculous you'll be hard pressed not to laugh. 

Unless you're distracted by Nastassja Kinski's nude scene.
